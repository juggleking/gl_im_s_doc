            <MadCap:concept term="System management" />GLIMS upgrade - FAQ</h1>
        <h2>Issue with read-only files</h2>
        <p>In previous GLIMS versions, some files have been marked as <span class="ui_element">Read only</span>, which makes it impossible to replace these files by a GLIMS&#160;self-extracting ZIP file.</p>
        <p>During the installation of a GLIMS service pack, the following errors (or similar) can be produced:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/faq_read_only_1_338x142.png" style="width: 338;height: 142;" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/faq_read_only_2.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Solution</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Check that the application is fully stopped. In addition to the GLIMS&#160;client, this also applies to services and translators and the Glims9 AppServer when installing on the server.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Open a command prompt and run:</p>
                <p><span class="ui_element">attrib –r "c:\glims9" /S /D</span>
                </p>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Collation issue (–cpcoll parameter)</h2>
        <p>If you get the following error message when logging on to GLIMS after installing a GLIMS service pack, make sure that the <span class="ui_element">–cpcoll</span> parameter on the client matches the <span class="ui_element">–cpcol</span>l parameter on the server.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/faq_cpoll.png" />
        </p>
        <p>This parameter can be specified in the session.pf file located in the dat directory of your GLIMS installation folder.</p>
        <p><a class="MCPopupThumbnailLink MCPopupThumbnailPopup" href="images/faq_cpoll_2.png"><img class="MCPopupThumbnail img imgLargeImage" data-mc-width="605" data-mc-height="606" src="images/faq_cpoll_2_thumb_0_120.png" tabindex="" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>As of GLIMS version 9.3, the <span class="ui_element">–cpcoll</span> parameter is to <span class="ui_element">basic</span> by default.  Older GLIMS version might still use <span class="ui_element">basic9</span>.</p>
        <h2>What happens if you upgrade from Glims 9.1 to Glims 9.4 ?</h2>
        <p>This concerns two minor version upgrades:  the schema changes 9.1-&gt; 9.3 are applied, followed by the schema changes 9.3-&gt;9.4 ; when this is done, the conversion procedures 9.1-&gt;9.3 are executed, followed by the conversion procedures 9.3-&gt;9.4 ; the task to perform the “PostUpgradeDuringRoutine” command is scheduled.</p>
        <h2>What happens if you upgrade from Glims 8.X to Glims 9.4 ?</h2>
        <p>Our installshield/pinstall tools will first upgrade the Glims 8 database to Glims 9.1;  When you first connect to Glims then, it will perform the minor upgrades on the fly, as described above.</p>
        <h2>Has doing the major upgrade v8-&gt; v9 been improved ?</h2>
        <p>Glims 8 has a history of more than 6 years, during which a lot of site attributes have been introduced on the data.  All of this data is to be converted to real database fields when migrating to Glims 9.  The longer a database remains on v8, the heavier the db conversion will be.  The deletion of the site attributes has been moved to the post-upgrade task, which is executed by a cron job during routine.  Some site attribute conversions are now also done during this phase (while the lab is back up).  The good news is that conversions of site attributes will no longer be necessary in the future.</p>
        <h2>What are the plans to improve the v8-v9 upgrade further more ?</h2>
        <p>Besides the conversion of site attributes, the index build is also a lengthy operation.</p>
        <p>One thing we could do, is –despite the limitations- build some of the new v9 indexes online on Glims8, while the lab continues its work.   We need some kind of “database upgrade assistant” for this in v8.   Online index build on v8 of the v9 indexes of large data areas could significantly reduce the down time of the offline index build v8-&gt;v9.</p>
        <h2>I cannot find 32bit or 64bit .pl libraries on UNIX</h2>
        <p>Progress libraries on OpenEdge 11 are compatible with the 32bit and the 64bit product.  32bit product on Unix is only available on Linux.  Aix etc are all 64bit products.  HP-UX PA-RISC is no longer supported.</p>
        <h2>There is a new function but no corresponding menu item</h2>
        <p>When a new function is introduced in a corrective version, the corresponding menu item is not automatically added to the main or popup menus. New menu items must therefore be added manually to the menus.&#160;The chapter "Menu customization" describes how to do so.</p>
        <h2>Some more troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>The auto db upgrade mechanism must be able to provide feedback to the user, also when there is no database connection present.  That's why error message codes from the database cannot be used. Here’s a list of error messages and their cause.  Log messages and more are written to a logfile, which is found in the session’s temp directory (-T value) ; the filename is of the form  &lt;dbname&gt;_upgrade_&lt;date&gt;_&lt;time&gt;.log</p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">The .r code you are running requires schema version &amp;1 for db '&amp;2', but the genro db or data you are using cannot be used to upgrade automatically (out of date)</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>The  .r code (.pl libraries), requires a certain schema version, but the genro database or data does not contain the required information to upgrade the database because its outdated.  That’s why the auto-upgrade mechanism cannot proceed.   The genro database is out-dated.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Database xx requires an index index rebuild</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p> Some schema change has added an index to an existing table.  You need to activate the index with Progress db utilities (v9.1-&gt; v9.3 only).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Connected to &amp;1 through the network – WARNING</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>You are upgrading the progress db from a remote client (-H -S connection); this may be considerably slower than a shared memory connection and is not recommended.  The auto-upgrade mechanism will not be able to replace the genro database with a new version in case this would be necessary.</p>

        <p class="fieldlabel">Database in use by….</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>Some schema change cannot be done online while other processes are connected to the database.  Disconnect appservers and clients.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">The .r code you are running is of an older version than the last db upgrade (&amp;1) code: &amp;2, db: &amp;3</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>Development versions only.  Your .r code is of an older version than the actual database schema version.</p>
