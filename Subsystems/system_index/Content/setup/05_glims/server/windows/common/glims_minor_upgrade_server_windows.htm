            <MadCap:concept term="System management" />GLIMS - Minor upgrade on a Windows server</h1>
        <div class="text_box_warnings">After installing the new minor GLIMS version, it will not be possible anymore to revert to the previous version.&#160;<br />Make sure you have a valid backup before installing the service pack:<br />- Make a copy of the contents of the Glims installation folder<br />-&#160;Make sure you have a valid database backup: Either make a new backup, or check the last backup and  the availability of the after image/archive log files.<br /></div>
        <h2>Upgrade procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you are on GLIMS&#160;9.5 or older, please get help from a MIPS representative to do the upgrade</span>
            </li>
            <li value="2">If you are already on GLIMS v9.6 version or newer, take the following steps:<ol><li value="1">Make sure all clients are disconnected</li><li value="2">Make sure the application system is fully stopped (translators, services and appservers): <code>mam glims stop</code><code><br /></code></li><li value="3">Run the <b>minor version</b> (version ending with ".0") self extractor (e.g. Glims<b>9.8.0</b>Progress116_pid1.exe)</li><li value="4">Make sure that the "Extract to:" path points to your GLIMS installation folder<br /></li><li value="5">Click the "Extract" button and wait for the extraction to complete (e.g. c:\glims9)<br /><br /><img src="servicepack.png" /><br /></li><li value="6">Run the <b>corrective version</b> self extractor (e.g. Glims<b>9.8.2</b>Progress116_pid3.exe)</li><li value="7">Make sure that the "Extract to:" path points to your GLIMS installation folder</li><li value="8">Click the "Extract" button and wait for the extraction to complete (e.g. c:\glims9)</li><li value="9">Optional: Copy the genro.* database files found in &lt;glims folder&gt;/dbf to the folder where the genro database actually reside (this is optional, but avoids the creation of  a new genro db on the fly); if the database has servers running for it, stop it, copy the db and restart.  "prostrct repair" is not necessary.</li><li value="10">Restart the application system without services and translators: <code>mam glims start.</code><span style="color: #ff0000;"> <br />Make sure that no clients connect before the minor version upgrade has finished</span>.</li><li value="11">Start an interactive GLIMS session.&#160;The auto upgrade mechanism of the interactive client should detect that an upgrade is required and initiate the conversion procedures.</li><li value="12">After the automatic upgrade, the services and translators can be started</li></ol><p>&#160;</p></li>
        </ol>
        <div class="text_box_tips">Do not copy individual files (e.g. func.pl and corr.pl) from one system to another. Always extract the full service pack into the GLIMS folder.&#160;Some files are dependent on other files in the service pack.</div>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Practical recommendations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Shut down the AppServer before upgrading; disconnect other clients as well.</li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>When upgrading from version 9.1, some newindexes are added to existing tables.  They are added as inactive. GLIMS may prompt to build inactive indexes offline.  This is not the case anymore inupgrades from later versions.</p>
                <p>In order to build the indexes, stop the database broker  and use:</p>
                <div class="indented">
                    <p><i>proutil &lt;dbname&gt; -C idxbuild inactiveindexes</i>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>In case you have after imaging you must disable before doing the index build:</p>
                <div class="indented">
                    <p><i>rfutil &lt;dbname&gt; -C aimage end</i>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>After the index build, you have to enable AI again and the archiver as well:</p>
                <div class="indented">
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">probkup &lt;dbname&gt; /mybckdir/mybackup.bck<br />rfutil &lt;dbname&gt;  -C aimage begin<br />rfutil &lt;dbname&gt; -C aiarchiver  enable</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li value="3">When you upgrade a Progress db from v8.X to v9, these new indexes are added during the v8-&gt;v9 upgrade, and built during the offline index build of this major upgrade.   The subsequent minor upgrade will detect that the required index is already present.</li>
            <li value="4">When you upgrade to any minor and corrective version, make sure to have also the most recent corrective service pack version applied, before you connect to the application (which initiates the upgrade process).</li>
            <li value="5">Some environment variables can control the behaviour of the upgrade mechanism:<ul><li value="1">MA_AUTODBUPGRADE (default TRUE, switch upgrade mechanism on or off).</li><li value="2">MA_AUTODBUPGRADEDEBUG (default FALSE, show additional messages during the upgrade process)</li><li value="3">MA_AUTODBUPGRADEPROFILING (default FALSE, when set to TRUE, it enables the progress profiler during the upgrade for performance analysis).</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Background information</h2>
        <p>One of the goals we have, is to limit down time to a minimum, and enable customers or service people to upgrade the application and database with a minimum of expertise required.   The software should upgrade the database on the fly, as it detects when an upgrade is needed.  How does this happen ? There is a built-in <span class="ui_element">auto db upgrade mechanism</span>, which works as follows:</p>
        <p>The compiled ABL code of the version contains in itself what schema version is required to run the installed software version.   When you connect to the application, it compares these version numbers to the ones stored in the genrw table "gp_DbVersion".  If the values in this table are lower than the ones from the code, a database schema upgrade is needed.   What scripts to run in order to perform this upgrade, are contained in the genro data tables.  If we cannot detect the correct data there to perform the upgrade, then this means that the genro data is not up to date.  In that case, the genro tables are to be reloaded with the data shipped along with the release (files in the "dbs" folder, different mechanisms for Progress and Oracle databases apply).  Once the genro data is up to date, the required scripts to make the necessary schema changes are applied.  For a Progress database, these are .df statements, for an Oracle database we are using scripts to upgrade the schema holder, along with SQL ddl-scripts to upgrade the Oracle db itself.</p>
        <p>Once all schema changes are applied, some conversion procedures are executed.  When finished, your GLIMS installation is upgraded.  That is, almost:</p>
        <div class="indented">Some upgrades require lengthy conversion procedures to be run.  In many cases, it is harmless to run them while the lab has already resumed activity.  For this purpose, GLIMS automatically configures a command and task called "PostConversionDuringRoutine"; it is by default executed daily, every night at 22h00.</div>
        <div class="text_box_notes">
            <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
            </p>
            <p>From GLIMS 9.6 on, menus are automatically regenerated during the migration to major and minor <a href="../../../../00_version_terminology/version_terminology.htm">versions</a>. This means that, when a version contains new functions, the corresponding new menu items are automatically added to the menus. Manual addition  of new menu items to the menus (see chapter Menu customization) is only necessary when upgrading to a corrective version.</p>
