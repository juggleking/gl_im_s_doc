        <h1>Release notes v6.2.0 - Connections  between Dashboard<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.SampleNet only">/NagiosAgent</MadCap:conditionalText> and Daemon (WatchDog-00194)</h1>
        <p>Watchdog has always communicated via short-lived socket connections. While this is a proven approach for the interaction of faceless processes, it has a number of disadvantages for Watchdog - specifically for communication between Daemon on the one hand, and Dashboard <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.SampleNet only">or NagiosAgent </MadCap:conditionalText>on the other hand. As soon as users launch the Dashboard in an environment other than directly on the server via a remote desktop connection, we collide with network security rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Dashboard must be allowed to open its own server socket</li>
            <li value="2">Daemon must be allowed to connect to the server port of each Dashboard</li>
        </ul>
        <p>System administrators at customer site were then required to setup their firewall rules to allow the Dashboard to open its own server socket and then again to allow the Daemon to connect on this server socket port. This situation became even more complicated when trying to get Dashboards running on Citrix / Terminal Server environments, as a server port is only available to a single server socket.</p>
        <p>In addition, customers have reported several headaches with Dashboards in the field:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">stale reverse DNS lookup data can prevent the Daemon from reaching the Dashboard, even when firewall allows it</li>
            <li value="2">running on computers with multiple network interfaces can be problematic if Dashboard picks the wrong IP-address</li>
            <li value="3">VPN connections suffer from similar problems, as the Dashboard may be reporting an IP-address that the Daemon cannot reach</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Watchdog now uses a different approach for communication between Daemon on the one hand, and Dashboard<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.SampleNet only"> or NagiosAgent</MadCap:conditionalText> on the other hand, by means of long-lived socket connections. The Dashboard<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.SampleNet only"> or NagiosAgent </MadCap:conditionalText>opens a socket connection to the Daemon, and this connection is kept alive to send model updates and other messages from the Daemon back to the Dashboard<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.SampleNet only"> or NagiosAgent</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p>Note that the Dashboard will still use a different connection to send 'Start', 'Stop' or 'Disconnect' requests, as such requests are best served via short-lived socket connections.</p>
