        <h1>Release notes </h1>
        <h2>Version 3.1.0</h2>
        <h3>LogViewer-00028: Unable to close LogViewer when processing large amounts 
 of updates (3201, 3270)</h3>
        <p>In previous versions, it could happen that a user was unable to close 
 the LogViewer application when it was processing a large amount of updates 
 to one file. When the LogViewer was opened from within the application, 
 not the desktop, it was impossible to halt the process without bringing 
 down the entire application. This meant that the application remained 
 unresponsive.</p>
        <p>This has been corrected.</p>
        <p>Please note however that, if the LogViewer is processing such "high 
 volume log files" and a user attempts to close the window, it could 
 take some time before the window actually closes.</p>
        <h2>Version 3.0.0</h2>
        <h3>LogViewer-00025: LogViewer uses .Net 4.0</h3>
        <p>The LogViewer application now uses the latest version of the .Net Framework 
 (.Net 4.0) in order to be in line with the version installed by Progress 
 OpenEdge 11.</p>
        <h3>LogViewer-00027: LogViewer hangs when multiple sessions are opened 
 (2927)</h3>
        <p>When starting multiple LogViewer sessions from the application, it could 
 happen that the LogViewer froze when switching between sessions. This 
 has been corrected.</p>
        <h2>Version 2.2.0</h2>
        <h3>LogViewer-00012: Ability to open up the folder containing the log-file 
 from the LogViewer</h3>
        <p>The MultiLogViewer has been upgraded in order to support <a href="Log_viewer_-_Functions.htm">opening 
 an entire folder</a> through drag and drop (only). Instead of having to 
 open every file one by one in a folder it is now possible to simply drag 
 a folder to the MultiLogViewer. The tool will then open up all the files 
 in the directory. Please note that the tool will NOT go through subdirectories.</p>
        <p>Additionally the MultiLogViewer now also has the ability to have multiple 
 files/folders dropped onto it or a combination of folders and files. It 
 will then go through the files in the dropped directories and open every 
 single file as well.</p>
        <h3>LogViewer-00021: Auto-reset focus (2697)</h3>
        <p>In the previous version, LogViewer would always jump to the first selected 
 line whenever the log file was updated. This has been corrected. </p>
        <h3>LogViewer-00024: LogViewer hangs while processing large updates to 
 files (2686)</h3>
        <p>It could happen that the LogViewer froze while processing changes/updates 
 to log files which are being updated very frequently and you want to close 
 the LogViewer during this processing. This has now been solved.</p>
