This table serves to enter payments made by Payers. The Payment table is a subtype of FinancialTransaction, therefore it can be balanced with other financial transactions like Gain and InvoiceSummary. Payments can be entered manually or automatically via a payments file from a Bank.
<br />The Payment Editor allows not only fast manual entry of payments. It also has several options for finding invoice summaries (or other financial transactions) that match the payment. The 'Date', 'Internal Id', 'Amount', 'Firm', 'Unbal Am', 'Status' and 'Payer' fields are the actual fields of the Payment. The 'Account' field is the BankAccount that is actually stored with the 'Payer'. The 'Reference' field and the column of 4 fields to the right of the 'Payer' fields are from the 'PaymentInfo' record that is associated with the Payment. The 'Transactions' browser at the bottom shows the financial transactions that are already balanced with this payment and also possible candidate transactions. When creating a new payment, this browser is empty. When editing an existing payment, this browser initially contains only the financial transactions that are already balanced with this payment. The editor has the following features: 
<br />+ If F7 is typed in the 'Reference' field, the editor searches for unbalanced invoice summaries with this payment reference and adds them to the Transactions browser. Any non-selected transactions are removed from the browser. This functionality is also triggered when leaving the reference field after a change. If exactly 1 matching invoice summary is found with the correct amount it is also selected immediatly.
<br />+ If F7 is typed in the 'Payer' name or id field, the editor searches for unbalanced invoice summaries of this Payer and adds them to the Transactions browser. Any non-selected transactions are removed from the browser.
<br />+ Typing the space-bar on a record in the 'Transactions' browser toggles selection/deselection of a financial transaction. If a financial transaction is selected this way, the Payer and Firm of that financial transaction are copied to the corresponding fields of the Payment, if they were still unknown.
<br />+ The 'Payer' name and id fields have the usual possibilities of scrolling with the arrow keys or searching with CTRL-F. 
<br />+ The PaymentInfo fields are ordinary text fields and usually contain the payer identification as received from the Bank. Typing the up or down arrow key on the payment info's 'payer name' field, tries to locate this correspondent based on the Name and display the closest match in the actual Payer field to the left. From there the user can scroll and search.
<br />+ Typing F6 on a Transaction record, zooms in on the financial transaction.
<br />+ Selecting &lt;OK&gt; saves the changes, and balances the Payment with the selected financial transactions. Also The PaymentInfo BankAccount number is copied to the BankAccount of the Payer.</p><a name="Fields"></a>

Amount</h3>

This field specifies the amount of the payment. A positive amount means an actual payment to the Firm done by the Payer. Such payments can be balanced with debit invoice summaries (positive amount) or with gains (positive amount). A negative amount indicates that the payment is actually a refund by the Firm to the Payer. Such payments can be balanced with credit invoice summaries (negative amount) or losses (a gain with negative amount).</p>

Automatic balance with invoice summary&#160;
</h3>
        <div class="MemberHelp">
            <p>
This function tries to balance an unbalanced payment with an unbalanced invoice summary. This is done based on the value of 'PaymentReference' field of the PaymentInfo record that is associated with this payment. The algoritm used by this method is as follows:
<br />1. The invoice summary that has the same payment reference as the payment info associated with the payment, and the same Firm as the payment is located. If such an invoice summary is not found, then no match is found.
<br />2. If such an invoice summary is found that has an unbalanced amount that deviates less then "Maximum Deviation" % from the unbalanced amount of the payment (relative to the invoice summary 'TotalAmount' !!) then there is a match.
<br />3. If there was no match in point 2, then the same test as in point 2 is done for each invoice summary reminder of this invoice summary, taking into account the reminder's 'SupplementAmount', in order to find a match.
<br />4.In case there is a match in point 2 or 3, a balance record is created for the matching amount. Also:
<br />* The Payer of the payment is set to the Payer of the invoice summary.
<br />* If "Balance difference as gain" was specified, then any remaining unbalanced amount on the invoice summary or payment is balanced with a new Gain record. NOTE that any reminder supplement amount is always booked as a Gain record.
<br />* If the PaymentInfo record specified a bank account from which the payment was made, this bank account is copied to the bank account field of the Payer.
<br />* If "Delete Payment Info" was specified, the PaymentInfo record is deleted.</p>
