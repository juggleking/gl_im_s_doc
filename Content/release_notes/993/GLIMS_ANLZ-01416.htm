        <p>Every time GLIMS receives an ALL query requesting for cancelled- and/or finished tests, the receipt time of the query is stored in two hidden Station-based fields (one for cancelled tests and one for finished tests). This way, when receiving the next query, GLIMS only has to look for actions having changed in between two subsequent ALL queries.</p>
        <p>However, a performance issue was detected which was due to GLIMS always using the lowest of both receipt times if both were specified (if a query only requests for cancelled or finished tests, only the corresponding receipt time field is updated). Consequently, as the number of ready actions increases over time, the number of actions to process increases as well, which has a negative impact on the processing time of ALL queries.</p>
        <p>This issue, which occurred since GLIMS 9.5, has been corrected.</p>
