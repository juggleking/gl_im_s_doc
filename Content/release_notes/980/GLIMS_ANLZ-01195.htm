        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>A result scheduled on an action of station A can be provided by station B. If GLIMS is configured correctly, then the result received from station B is accepted as the result that was scheduled on station A. GLIMS will then move the <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Result</span> record from the action it was originally scheduled on (for station A)  to an action of station B. The action on station B may already have the status <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ready</span>.  </p>
        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Issue 1</p>
        <div class="indented" xmlns="">
            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the above-mentioned case, the action status is updated to a "non-ready" status if the relinked result is not confirmed / validated / discontinued. However, the <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ready time</span> of the updated action was not cleared, which could result in a "non-ready" action with a <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ready time</span>.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Issue 2</p>
        <div class="indented" xmlns="">
            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the result that is moved to an action of station B is automatically confirmed / validated / discontinued (e.g. via a MISPL trigger), then this can ensure that the action becomes <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ready</span> again. If this happened, GLIMS did not update the action's <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ready time</span> with the time the newly linked result was confirmed / validated / discontinued.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_box_notes" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
            </p>
            <p>Issues occurred since GLIMS&#160;9.0.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Consequences</h2>
        <p>In analyzer communication, analyzers querying GLIMS&#160;for finished tests might not get informed  as subsequent queries did not notice the action anymore after it was updated (i.e. after the newly received result was linked to it) because of the action's <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ready time</span> which was not updated.</p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An order is created containing the tests T1 and T2 on specimen S1 (both tests can be executed on stations ANLZ1 and ANLZ2, the <span class="ui_element">Procedure</span> option <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allow replacement</span> is enabled).</p>
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">=&gt; T1 and T2 are scheduled on an action of  ANLZ1.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ANLZ2 sends a result for T1.</p>
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">=&gt; A new action is created on ANLZ2 and the result for T1 is moved from the action on ANLZ1 to the newly created action on ANLZ2.</p>
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">=&gt; The result for T1 is automatically confirmed / validated.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">The action on ANLZ2 has status <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ready</span> because the result for T1 is automatically confirmed / validated.</li>
            <li value="4">
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ANLZ2 sends a result for T2.</p>
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">=&gt; The result for T2 is moved from the action on ANLZ1 to the action on ANLZ2.</p>
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">=&gt;&#160;The result for T2 is automatically confirmed / validated.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">The action on ANLZ2 becomes <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ready</span> again but its <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ready time</span> is not updated.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Suppose ANLZ1 and ANLZ2 are substations of a LAS&#160;querying GLIMS&#160;for finished tests. If the query would have been launched after GLIMS had received the result for T1 from ANLZ2, then the LAS&#160;would have been informed about the finished test T1 for specimen S1. However, if the query would have been launched after GLIMS&#160;had received the result for T2 from ANLZ2, then the LAS&#160;would never get an indication that T2 for specimen S1 is finished as well because of the action's <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ready time</span> which was not updated.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>This has been corrected.</p>
