        <h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Once you have completed your cell counter configuration, you can now 
 start the cell counter program. The cell counter program can 
 be accessed in several ways.</p>
        <h3>Directly from the main menu</h3>
        <p>Click <span class="ui_element">Start</span> -&gt; <span class="ui_element">Routine</span> -&gt; <span class="ui_element">Action</span> -&gt; <span class="ui_element">Cell 
 counter</span>.</p>
        <h3>From 
 an action context
        </h3>
        <h4>Action 
 browser</h4>
        <p>The main 
 application menu offers an action query/browser to provide quick access 
 to the cell counter program. It is available via <span class="ui_element">Start</span> -&gt; <span class="ui_element">Routine</span> 
 -&gt; <span class="ui_element">Actions</span> -&gt; <span class="ui_element">Browse actions</span>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>It offers the same query 
	 options as the standard action query (as used in the <a href="../confirmation_validation/confirmation_validation_confirm_by_action.htm">Confirm 
	 by action</a> program). The <span class="ui_element">Sort by</span> option 
	 is not available, as this action browser can be sorted by clicking 
	 column headers (see below).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>The action browser can be sorted 
	 on any column (e.g. Station) by clicking a column header.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>When pressing Enter 
	 or double-clicking, the cell counter will immediately be started 
	 for the selected action.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Pressing OK/Page 
	 Down or Page Up 
	 in the cell counter will navigate to the next or previous action respectively.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Work list grid</h4>
        <p>You can also start the cell counter program from a work list grid by 
 selecting the contextual menu function <span class="ui_element">Action</span> -&gt; <span class="ui_element">Cell counter</span>.</p>
        <h3>From a specimen context</h3>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li value="1">
                <p>The cell counter can also be started from a specimen 
	 context, e.g. the Specimens of order browser. Use 
	 the Specimen contextual menu function 
	 <span class="ui_element">Open cell counter</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Pressing OK/Page 
	 Down or Page Up 
	 in the cell counter will navigate to the next or previous specimen 
	 respectively.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>From a result context</h3>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li value="1">
                <p>The cell counter can also be started from a result 
	 context, e.g. the "Results of order" browser. Use 
	 the new Result contextual menu function 
	 <span class="ui_element">Open cell counter</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Pressing OK/Page 
	 Down or Page Up 
	 in the cell counter will navigate to the next or previous result respectively.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Screen synchronization</h3>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li value="1">
                <p>Select an Order from an Order browser.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Right-click <span class="ui_element">Request</span> -&gt; <span class="ui_element">Specimens</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>On a Specimen, right-click <span class="ui_element">Open cell counter</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>When navigating to another order, the specimen browser 
	 and cell counter will both be synchronized.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>General information</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><a class="MCPopupThumbnailLink MCPopupThumbnailPopup" href="cellcounter_standalone.gif" data-mc-popup-alt=""><img class="MCPopupThumbnail img imgLargeImage" data-mc-width="675" data-mc-height="416" src="cellcounter_standalone_thumb_0_120.png" alt="" tabindex="" /></a>

        <h4>When started from the main menu</h4>
        <div class="indented">
            <p class="MsoNormal">When starting the cell counter from the main menu, 
 the user should select a <span class="ui_element">Station</span>, a <span class="ui_element">Specimen</span>, and a <span class="ui_element">Procedure</span>. 
 The station is obviously the manual count station. When entering a bar 
 code, the program will try to find the corresponding specimen, using the 
 count station's identification settings. When a specimen is found, the 
 program will generate a list of procedures of this station which could 
 be used to produce results for at least one of the existing results of 
 this specimen. Note that this may imply selecting the station's 
 manual count procedure for use on a result which was originally scheduled 
 for another procedure of another station, but which can also be counted 
 via this procedure.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">If more than one procedure is found, the user will 
 have to select the desired procedure manually. This can occur when this 
 station is able to perform several count procedures and the count procedures 
 are both requested for the current specimen. If only one such 
 procedure is found, this procedure is selected automatically. In the other 
 case, the user has to select the correct procedure.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">The user is then able to start the counting process. After 
 committing the screen, he can enter a new bar code without having to restart 
 the program.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>When started from the action context</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <p>When started from the action context (e.g. from a work list), the station, 
 specimen and procedure will already be selected.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Remarks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">No counting is allowed when one of the cells belonging to the formula 
	 has a status 'Confirmed' or higher.</li>
            <li value="2">During the counting process, the standard specimen contextual menu is 
	 available.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Left frame</h3>
        <p>In the left frame, the properties to be counted 
 are listed (i.e. all <a href="cell_counter_procedure_outputs.htm">property 
 outputs</a> for which a counter key label is defined in the <a href="cell_counter_assessment_method.htm">assessment 
 method</a>). You can count the cells by using the keys defined 
 in the assessment methods. The key for each property is displayed in the 
 first column. The <span class="ui_element">Customize</span> button allows to enter new 
 key codes in the key code column of the browser. These new key codes are 
 user-specific. Upon committing the screen, these preferences will be stored. It 
 is also possible to increment or decrement any counter by hitting the 
 right arrow or left arrow when the browser with the count cells is positioned 
 on the cell whose counter you want to change. This allows for corrections 
 after or during the counting process. The <span class="ui_element">Reset</span> button 
 allows to clear all entered counts. The user-defined result 
 colors are also used in this cell count program.</p>
        <p>When the <a href="cell_counter_procedure.htm">count limit</a> is reached, 
 the word 'Ready' will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. If 
 you want a sound to be played when you reach the count limit, simply copy 
 a wave file called "CountFinished.wav" in the "snd" 
 sub-directory of GLIMS. When a <a href="cell_counter_procedure.htm">cell 
 count cycle</a> is specified, the user will also get an audible signal 
 (snd/CountCycle.wav) each time this number of cells have been counted.</p>
        <p>When <a href="cell_counter_procedure.htm">cell count property</a> has 
 been defined, the cell counter will show an extra column in the counter 
 browser, displaying the <b>absolute values of the counted fractions</b> 
 (i.e. fraction (in %) * Procedure.CellCountProperty result value / 100). These 
 values are only shown to check the results of the counting process. They 
 are not stored in the database.</p>
        <p>The <b>last result values</b> of the formula are shown in a separate 
 column in the count browser. These 'last known results' may very well 
 be obtained via another procedure (e.g. the automated cell counting via 
 analyzer).</p>
        <h3>Upper right frame</h3>
        <p>In the upper right frame, the properties 
 of the procedure which do not have to be counted are displayed, i.e. all 
 <a href="cell_counter_procedure_outputs.htm">property outputs</a> for 
 which no counter key label is defined in the <a href="cell_counter_assessment_method.htm">assessment 
 method</a>.</p>
        <p>For these results, the last known value of 
 each result will be proposed as new value. When one of these 
 last results had already received a value, committing a new count will 
 always result in discontinuing the old results and creating a new action 
 for the manual count procedure.</p>
        <p>Result code look up is also possible. When 
 using the keystroke CTRL-F for a non-countable result, a selection list 
 pops up with all possible choices. The list contains all applicable 
 result codes and, if the property is enumerated, the choices.</p>
        <h3>Lower right frame</h3>
        <p>In the lower right frame, you will see the information requested 
 in your <a href="cell_counter_procedure_data.htm">procedure 
 data</a> configuration. These values are accompanied by their object 
 time if different from the object time of the action being processed. Any 
 <b>property input results</b> of the action are also added to the already 
 shown property data result.</p>
        <h3>Buttons</h3>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Reset</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>Allows to clear all entered 
	 counts.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Customize</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>Allows to enter new 
	 key codes in the key code column of the browser. These new key codes 
	 are user-specific. Upon committing the screen, these preferences will 
	 be stored.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Specimen</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>Opens a browser 
	 with all specimens for which you performed a counting during this 
	 session.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Bottom of the screen</h3>
        <p>At the bottom of the Cell counter screen a trail will be displayed with your latest actions.</p>
        <h3>Image results</h3>
        <p>Available results of data type 'Image' automatically pop-up in one single 
 frame. The frame automatically appears as images are available, and disappears 
 if there are none.</p>
        <p>This is accomplished by means of an embedded Internet Explorer window. 
 It can be resized as desired, in which case the images will automatically 
 re-arrange. Images can be viewed full-size by clicking on the initial 
 image. The latter may require the following Internet Explorer option to 
 be set: Tools &gt; Internet Options... Advanced &gt; Security &gt; Allow 
 active content to run in files on My Computer. The HTML content 
 is hard-coded and cannot be configured.</p>
        <p>The images are collected and sorted as follows:</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p class="fieldlabel">QUERY</p>
            <ul>
