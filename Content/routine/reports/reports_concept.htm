        <h1><a href="../index_routine.htm">Basic routine</a> -&gt; <a href="index_reports.htm" name="kanchor78">Reports</a> 
 -&gt; Introduction</h1>
        <p>The report model has different tables for Report, Report Page, Report 
 Group, Report Column, Report Template, and Default Report.&#160;&#160;Check 
 the report ERD model for an overview of all report-related table relations.</p>
        <p>In essence, a Report Group gathers all reports having the same scope, 
 Property Classification, column grouping, and columns per page.</p>
        <p>'Same scope' in this context is interpreted as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">All Object reports for the same object.</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">All Year reports for the same object and the same 
	 year.</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="3">All Encounter reports for the same encounter.</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="4">All Order reports for the same object.</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="5">All specimen reports for the same object.</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="6">All day reports for the same object.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This way, a Report Group can more or less be interpreted as a 'patient 
 file' for a given subset of a patient's results (the Property Classification), 
 organized in a certain way (the column grouping), and with a certain number 
 of columns per page.</p>
        <div class="text_box_notes" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
            </p>
            <p xmlns="">For order, Specimen and Day reports, the Report Group's 'Columns 
 per Page' is not filled in, since for these reports, all results of the 
 same order, specimen or day will be forced on the same page.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When an order is created, its results are assigned to Report Columns 
 of Report Groups, according to the <a href="../../configuration/default_reports/default_reports.htm">DefaultReport</a> 
 configuration. Following the DefaultReport's and its <a href="../../configuration/report_templates/report_templates.htm">ReportTemplate's 
 settings</a>, one ore more columns are created (e.g. one per object time, 
 one per specimen...).</p>
        <p>Each Report Column refers to its Report Group. According to the Report 
 Group's Columns per Page setting, these Report Columns are also assigned 
 to Report Pages, which are simply a way of storing which report columns 
 should be printed on the same page. A report group has a Scope, refers 
 to an Object and a <a href="../../configuration/property_classifications/property_classifications.htm">Property 
 Classification</a>, and has a Grouping and Columns per Page field, both 
 taken from the Report Template. An encounter reference is filled in for 
 encounter report groups, while for year reports, the year number is stored.</p>
        <p>A Report Page refers to a Report Group and has a sequence number, and 
 optionally refers to an order (for Order and Specimen reports), a specimen 
 (for Specimen reports), or a date (for Day reports).</p>
        <p>For Order, Specimen and Day reports, a separate Report Page is created 
 per order, specimen or day. For all other types of reports, the report 
 pages are created according to the Report Group's Columns per Page settings.</p>
        <p>A Report Column refers to its Report Page, its Report Group, has a sequence 
 number within the Report Page, and an optional reference to an Order (for 
 column grouping by Order, by Order and Date, and by Specimen), a Specimen 
 (for column grouping by specimen), or an Object and a Time (for column 
 grouping by Object Time).</p>
        <p>For each report copy (including the original!) that actually has to 
 be sent, a Report record is created to indicate that a certain report 
 page has to be sent to a specific target, using a specific Report Template 
 (i.e. the layout), via a specific medium (mail, e-mail...).</p>
        <p>The Report table itself has a reference to a report page, combining 
 all reports that are actually different copies of the same information. 
 This implies that a HL-7 or a normal paper report concerning the same 
 order, using the same property classification and using the same column 
 grouping can refer to the same report page.</p>
        <p>Each physical report page has its own Report Page and related Report 
 records.&#160;&#160;This allows for an efficient marking and generation 
 of reports which have new results, and allows for the possibility to reprint 
 a single page of an existing encounter report. Additionally, the page's 
 content is determined via the Report Column records. This implies that 
 the same columns are always printed on the same page, even when an additional 
 order, which has to be printed on a previous page, is later being inserted. 
 When this occurs, the correct new column position for the new order is 
 determined, and the existing columns of the corresponding page are shifted 
 to the right. When this leads to a report page having more report columns 
 that allowed by the template's column count setting, an overflow page 
 will be printed during report printing, to accommodate for those columns 
 which do not fit on the first page, rather than affecting the following 
 existing Report Page.</p>
