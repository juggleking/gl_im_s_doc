 and specimen reports</h1>
        <p>In the <a href="../../../configuration/default_reports/default_reports.htm">default report configuration</a>, 
 it is possible to specify a <b>scope</b>, which indicates WHAT should 
 appear on the report.</p>
        <p align="left" class="fieldlabel">Encounter 
 reports</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p align="left" style="text-align: left;"> All results obtained during the encounter of a patient will 
 be reported. These results will be divided into different segments (columns). 
 Placing all the reports in a row, will provide a complete overview.</p>
        </div>
        <p align="left" class="fieldlabel">Year 
 reports</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p align="left" style="text-align: left;"> All results obtained for a patient during an entire year 
 will be reported.</p>
        </div>
        <p align="left" class="fieldlabel">Object 
 report</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p align="left" style="text-align: left;"> Extended year reports. All results for a patient will appear 
 on the report, without any time-related criteria.</p>
        </div>
        <p align="left" class="fieldlabel">Specimen 
 report</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p align="left" style="text-align: left;"> All results for one particular specimen will be put on one 
 report. E.g. An order has three different specimen =&gt; each specimen 
 will be put on a separate report. Results which are not linked to a specimen 
 (e.g. weight of the patient) will be included on each report.</p>
        </div>
        <h3><a name="kanchor134"></a>Sending multiple copies of the same encounter, year or object report 
 and using these reports as 'Copy' reports.</h3>
        <p>In previous releases, a single encounter, year or object report was 
 created per object, scope and template. This implied that an existing 
 report was simply re-routed to the new target when a new order for the 
 same patient was entered. This was consistent with the idea of having 
 a 'patient file' which simply followed the patient and where any new pages 
 where simply sent to wherever the patient was being treated. This method 
 also implied that it was very difficult to use these types of reports 
 for sending copies to other recipients, or even to different issuers of 
 orders appearing on the same report page.</p>
        <p>In the new model, this limitation has been lifted. Since each page of 
 such a report has its own Report Page and Report records, it is possible 
 to specify that a certain report page should be sent to different recipients, 
 either as originals (e.g. each issuer on a page gets his own printout), 
 or as copies. This has in fact become the default behavior: each target 
 gets his own copy of the report page.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible to specify, in the Default Report that triggers 
 a report, that the report is not 'Target specific'. When this field is 
 set to False, an existing report for the same page, the same template 
 and the same medium will be rerouted in order to refer to the new target, 
 in stead of creating a new report. In this case, it becomes impossible 
 to know who received a copy of such a report in the past.</p>
        <p>As it is possible to send a separate copy to each recipient, is also 
 possible to add a copy of all missing pages to a (new) recipient's report 
 list.&#160; This is accomplished via the DefaultReport.AddMissingPages 
 field. When this field is set, upon creation of a new report targeted 
 for a certain recipient, the previous pages of the same report group are 
 checked, and a new report record is created for each page for which no 
 report was sent to this recipient. This allows sending a copy of the patient's 
 file pages that were added since a given correspondent last received a 
 page from this report. </p>
        <h3>Reprinting a page of an encounter, year or object report</h3>
        <p>Since each physical page is represented by its own Report Page record 
 and each printout of this page by its own Report records, it is easy to 
 reprint such a page, without having to reprint the other pages of the 
 same report group.</p>
        <p>The desired page can either be found via the Order.Report() browser, 
 or via the Object.ReportGroups browser.</p>
        <h3>Suppressing discontinued report columns of an encounter, year or object 
 report</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">When the text report program detects that a column 
 is completely empty (e.g. all of the results have been discontinued), 
 the column is suppressed on the report, and any remaining columns are 
 shifted to the left. </li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">When an order is being discontinued completely, the 
 program will try to delete any scheduled report columns and report copies 
 containing results of this order.&#160; All reports which were already 
 sent containing this column (Report.LastOutputTime &gt; ReportColumn.CreationTime) 
 will be marked with 'NeedsChecking=Yes' and 'Active=No', in order to allow 
 sending a corrective or discontinuation report.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Using the Report.Order field</h3>
        <p>The field Report.Order normally refers to the most recent order necessitating the
current report. For order-scoped reports, this is obviously the original order itself. For encounter reports, object reports or year reports, this field is not as unambiguous,&#160;
since the report can contain several orders.&#160; It is therefore never a good idea to use the Report.Order reference in the report configuration.</p>
        <p>However, as stated above, the field should normally refer to the most recent order
of the report page.&#160; In the case where an order is created, having a lower object time than the most recent order on a report, a new column is inserted in the report.&#160;
This may necessitate moving the most recent column(s) of this report to a new page. In this case, the Report.Order reference of the old report will be updated.</p>
        <h3>Re-organizing year, object or encounter reports</h3>
        <p>The function ReportGroup.Reorganize() reorganizes all existing columns in a 
year, object or encounter report group. All columns are sorted by their sorting 
time and are assigned to new pages if required. The program makes sure that when 
a report column is moved to another page, the required Report records are moved 
or created, making sure that if a target was scheduled to receive a copy from 
the report page containing column X, this will still be the case after the 
reorganization.</p>
        <p>This function is executed automatically for each year, object or encounter 
report when a Person.Merge operation is being performed. Typically, after such 
an operation the pages of the 2 originals person's object reports are merged 
together, thus yielding a bad sorting order of the contained columns. The 
automatic execution of ReportGroup.Organize() makes sure the columns are 
reorganized as necessary.</p>
