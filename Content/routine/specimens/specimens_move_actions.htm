        <h1>Move actions to another specimen</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>GLIMS allows to move actions from one specimen to another. &#160;This 
 can happen when:</p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Aa specimen is queried by an instrument</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>When receiving a query for a specimen for which no single action is 
	 scheduled on the querying station, GLIMS will try to move actions 
	 from related specimens to the one being queried.&#160;&#160;The service 
	 log file will log the fact that an action of a procedure has been 
	 moved from one specimen to another.<br /></p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">A specimen is scanned in the specimen 
	 scan program</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>The <a href="specimens_scan.htm">specimen scan program</a> will move 
	 actions to the scanned&#160;specimen whenever required and possible. 
	 </p>
        </div>
        <p>Specimens can also be moved manually using the <a href="specimens_replace.htm">Specimen.Replace</a> 
 function. This function only allows replacement of actions of the same procedure (and therefore the same material).</p>
        <h2>Conditions for moving actions</h2>
        <p>The movement of actions only takes place when the following conditions 
 are met:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="1">The specimen is for the same order, 
	 same material, same object, same sampling time and same discriminator.</li>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="2">The specimen is not discontinued.</li>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="3">If the queried/scanned specimen is a 
	 root specimen, the related specimen should also be a root specimen 
	 (see also <a href="#Root_and_sub_specimens">Root and sub specimens</a>).</li>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="4">If the queried/scanned specimen is a 
	 sub specimen, the related specimen should also be a sub specimen (see 
	 also <a href="#Root_and_sub_specimens">Root and sub specimens</a>).</li>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="5">The action's procedure must allow replacement 
	 (Procedure field <span class="ui_element">Allow replacement</span> must be enabled).</li>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="6">The action's procedure must be configured 
	 on the inquiring/scanning station (or related station (*)). 
	 &#160;If at least one property output of the procedure should 
	 be configured, enable the option <span class="ui_element">MoveIfKnownOutboundId</span> 
	 on the station.</li>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="7">The action should not yet be realized.</li>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="8">If the action is an action with 
	 results as outputs, then the action should not have been transmitted 
	 earlier (**).</li>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="9">If the action is an action with 
	 specimens as output, then none of these specimens should have an action 
	 which is transmitted earlier (**).</li>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="10">GLIMS will not move work 
	 from an action to a specimen being queried/scanned if the specimen 
	 from which outputs are being moved from was scanned earlier by the 
	 inquiring/scanning station. GLIMS recognizes the "source" 
	 specimen as being scanned when a scan event for the station is available 
	 in the specimen audit trail. &#160;One can disable the check on the 
	 scan event by enabling the logical Station field <span class="ui_element">Move work of 
	 scanned specimen</span> (by default it is disabled).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="fieldlabel">(*) Related station </p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>A station is related to the querying/scanning station 
 if the querying/scanning station is a concentrator and the related station 
 is a client of the concentrator OR the querying/scanning station is a 
 regular station (no concentrator, nor distributor) having a download group 
 to which the related station belongs.&#160;&#160;A related station can 
 also be a station related to a distributor station.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">(**) With a not transmitted action is meant</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>Not marked yet as queried by a station (Action.QueriedByStation is not 
 set), nor marked as downloaded to the inquiring station (Action.DownloadStatus 
 not set for that station, visible when doing Action -&gt; View download 
 status).</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Move actions between specimens of different material</h2>
        <p>GLIMS also allows to move the outputs of an action from a queried/scanned 
 specimen to a another specimen, on condition that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="1">Materials are from the same group (fill 
	 in a value in the field <span class="ui_element">Group</span> on material).</li>
            <li class="mips_list_numbered" value="2">The procedure of the queried/scanned 
	 specimen's actions and the procedure of the related specimen should 
	 belong to the same group (fill in a value in the field <span class="ui_element">Group</span> 
	 on procedure).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is even possible to set the compatibility of two specimen at run 
 time, for instance in the order entry triggers. One can assign a value 
 to the field "ReplacementGroup" on a specimen. This value overrules 
 the group field value of the specimen's material.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>When GLIMS has found a specimen related to the queried/scanned specimen 
 (because of same material group or specimen replacement group), it will 
 verify if the related specimen’s material has a compatible procedure configured. 
 A procedure is compatible when it belongs to the same group and when ALL 
 the outputs of the action on the queried/scanned specimen can be moved 
 to that procedure. If for instance the action of the queried/scanned specimen 
 has the results for properties RBC and WBC, then the compatible procedure 
 should at least have the same property outputs. Of course, the compatible 
 procedure should relate to the inquired station.</p>
        <p>GLIMS also assumes there will only be one compatible procedure. If more 
 than one procedure meets the conditions, GLIMS will take the one of the 
 same department as the action’s procedure of the queried/scanned specimen. 
 If still ambiguous, the move will not take place.</p>
        <h3><a name="Root_and_sub_specimens" id="Root_and_sub_specimens"></a>Root and 
 sub specimens</h3>
        <p>The restrictions already described above:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">If the queried/scanned specimen is a root specimen, the related 
	 specimen should also be a root specimen.</li>
            <li value="2">If the queried/scanned specimen is a sub specimen, the related 
	 specimen should also be a sub specimen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This will be overruled when the material of the specimen has a "group" 
 or when the queried/scanned specimen has a "replacement group'.</p>
        <h2>Moving actions after sort query</h2>
        <p>GLIMS allows to move actions between root specimens when being queried 
 by a distributor in slave mode (sort query). The conditions for moving 
 actions in case of a sort query are:</p>
        <p class="hcp1">Restrictions on the specimen being queried:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="p" value="1">
                <p>It is a root specimen.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p" value="2">
                <p>It should have no meaningful outputs, i.e. no actions 
	 with status less than ready and no actions having specimen outputs 
	 (sub specimens).</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p" value="3">
                <p>The specimen from which work could be moved from, 
	 may have been used for moving work before (note that the specimen 
	 audit trail logs a move event).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="hcp1">Restrictions on the specimen from which work could be moved 
 from:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="p" value="1">
                <p>It is a root specimen.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p" value="2">
                <p>If the root action delivers results, then the results 
	 are moved only if the root specimen was not sorted (*) yet to a zone 
	 of that action (<span class="ui_element">action -&gt; procedure -&gt; sorting target -&gt; 
	 zone</span>).</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p" value="3">
                <p>If the root action delivers sub specimens, then the 
	 sub specimens should not have been sorted (*) yet.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="fieldlabel">(*) The definition of 'sorted' is</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p> There was a sort result received 
 from the sorter, or there was a sort instruction sent to the sorter for 
 a zone not expecting a sort result. &#160;Sorting to error zones is not 
 considered as actual sort. Sorting to an archive zone for actions delivering 
 results is also not considered as actual sort.</p>
