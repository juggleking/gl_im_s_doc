        <h1>Work list selection download</h1>
        <p>It is possible to download a work list selection to an instrument.&#160;This can be achieved by means of the <span class="ui_element">Station</span> fields described 
 below.&#160;In case of an ALL-query from the analyzer, it is sufficient
 to enter a value for the fields described below and the work list selection 
 mechanism will be applied.&#160;However, in case of a sample query (single 
 sample or sample range),  the <span class="ui_element">Station</span> field <span class="ui_element">Sample 
 query by work list</span> has to be enabled as well.</p>
        <p><a class="MCPopupThumbnailLink MCPopupThumbnailPopup" href="work_list_selection_download.png"><img class="MCPopupThumbnail img imgLargeImage" data-mc-width="765" data-mc-height="531" src="work_list_selection_download_thumb_0_120.png" tabindex="" /></a>
        </p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Active work list name / Active work list creation time</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>Please check the chapter <a href="work_lists_active.htm">Active 
 work lists</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Worklist name pattern</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The pattern of a work list name can contain wildcard characters: a period (.) in a particular 
 position indicates that any single character is acceptable in that position; 
 an asterisk (*) indicates that any group of characters is acceptable, 
 including a null group of characters.</p>
            <div class="text_box_examples">
                <p><span style="color: #003366; font-weight: bold;">Example</span>
                </p>
                <p>hitachi* will result 
 in all work lists with names beginning with hitachi, such as hitachi747, 
 hitachi911, ...</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text_box_warnings">
                <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Warning</span>
                </p>
                <p>When a site function is specified in the general option <a href="../../configuration/specificsite/glims_general_options.htm">Worklist name</a> to define how automatically created work list names should look like, the Station field 'Worklist name pattern' must contain an actual pattern. When a fixed value, matching the worklist template name or part of it, is specified as 'Worklist name pattern', GLIMS will not find any work lists.</p>
                <p>For instance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">the Station field 'Worklist name pattern' is set to 'MyWorkList'</li>
                    <li value="2">the work list template name is MyWorkList</li>
                    <li value="3">
                        <p>the GLIMS General setting 'Worklist name'  generates a work list name that looks like 'MyWorklist &lt;year-worklist_identifier&gt;'</p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;">string InternalId;</p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;">InternalId := Identifier("Worklist",  DateToString(Today(),"%Y-"),  5);</p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;">RETURN  ifknownstring( .Name ) + " "+ Internalid;</p>
                        <p>Depending on the year and the identifier, GLIMS then generates the work list name 'MyWorkList 2021-0001'.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, with these settings, a work list query for this station will not return any work lists because GLIMS will not find any work lists named 'MyWorkList'. If 'Worklist name pattern' were set to 'MyWorkList<b>*</b>', GLIMS would find the work list named 'MyWorkList 2021-0001'.</p>
            </div>
            <p>When using this <span class="ui_element">Worklist name pattern</span>, you MUST also specify a <span class="ui_element">Worklist age</span> (see below).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Worklist age</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Maximal age in hours of a work list. Work lists that are older than the given number of hours since the time 
 of the station inquiry are not selected.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Worklist versions</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>Possible values: <span class="ui_element">Latest</span> / <span class="ui_element">All</span>.</p>
            <p>Allows you to indicate if only the latest version or all versions of a work list (with 
 the same name) should be selected.</p>
            <p>The work list download status 
 field (hidden field) will be updated whenever the work list is selected 
 by a station.&#160;The contextual function <span class="ui_element">View download status</span>&#160;
 shows a list with stations or station download groups for which the work 
 list has been download.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><a class="MCPopupThumbnailLink MCPopupThumbnailPopup" href="wltselected.gif"><img class="MCPopupThumbnail img imgLargeImage" data-mc-width="536" data-mc-height="225" src="wltselected_thumb_0_120.png" tabindex="" /></a>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the next station inquiry, the 
 work list will be selected again, except if the option <span class="ui_element">Check downloaded 
actions</span> is enabled for the inquiring station.&#160; You can clear the 
 work list download status using the contextual function <span class="ui_element">Clear download 
 status</span>.&#160;For more information, please check the chapter <a href="../../communication/analyzers/analyzers_download_status.htm">Analyzer 
 download status</a>.</p>
            <div class="text_box_examples">

                </p>
                <p>This functionality allows you  to send the same

        <p class="fieldlabel">Exclusive worklist selection</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>This field allows you to specify that a worklist selection configuration (a worklist selection configuration implies filling in the <span class="ui_element">Station</span> fields <span class="ui_element">Worklist name pattern</span>, <span class="ui_element">Worklist age</span>, <span class="ui_element">Worklist versions</span>) is only applicable to the station being queried for work orders.</p>
            <p>By default, this field is disabled. If enabled, GLIMS will ignore the worklist selection configuration when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">The querying station is a concentrator and the worklist selection configuration is on a client station of the concentrator.</li>
                <li value="2">The querying station is a distributor and the worklist selection configuration is on another distributor station in the same download group as the querying station.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before <span class="ui_element">Exclusive worklist selection</span> was available and work orders needed to be transmitted for a concentrator with a worklist selection configuration on a concentrator client station, GLIMS always selected actions of the client station via the work lists of the selection. However, this is not always the desired behaviour. The worklist selection configuration on the client station could be intended for the download of work orders requested by a translator for the client station only (and not for the concentrator).</p>

                </p>
                <p>If the configuration described in the example below is in place and you want to make sure that the corresponding action of a work list entry that is scheduled on a station that is not a client station of the concentrator is included in the work order message  sent in reply to the query received by the concentrator, then the work list selection configuration should not be on the concentrator (this means that the fields <span class="ui_element">Worklist name pattern</span> and <span class="ui_element">Worklist age</span> should be set to <span class="ui_element">?</span> and the options <span class="ui_element">Exclusive work list selection</span>, <span class="ui_element">Worklist items</span> and <span class="ui_element">Sample query by worklist</span> should be disabled) but on its client stations.
