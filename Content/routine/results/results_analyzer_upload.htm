        <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document describes how GLIMS selects an action during result upload and
 what happens in case of ambiguity.</p>
        <h2><a name="Action selection"></a>Action selection</h2>
        <p>The action selection is executed in the following order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">The first of a group of results that is sent simultaneously will determine the selected action.</li>
            <li value="2"> If a scheduled result is found that is ready to receive the result being uploaded, the corresponding action will be used.</li>
            <li value="3"> When no scheduled result is found for the current station, it is checked if there is a valid action to connect the result to. If ambiguous, the most recent action will always be
 chosen.</li>
            <li value="4"> All other results sent along with the first (in the same message) are considered to belong to the same action and hence linked to the same action record. If any of them were originally linked to another action, they will be re-linked.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="text_box_notes" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
            </p>
            <p xmlns=""> If a station sends a result for a property on a specimen, and
 we detect that this result was already stored by the same or another station,
 we will:</p>
            <ul xmlns="">
                <li value="1">Replace the result if it was not yet confirmed.</li>
                <li value="2">Reject the result if it was confirmed or discontinued.</li>
            </ul>
            <p xmlns="">One ambiguity cannot be resolved: if the first of a group of results is unsolicited. In that case the most recent action will always be
 chosen, regardless of possible other (scheduled) results in the same message.</p>
            <p xmlns="">You can reject unsolicited results from analyzers by disabling the field AssessmentMethod.StoreUnsolicited. This may
 also significantly speed up result upload from analyzers that tend to send much more results than were requested.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><a name="Ambiguity issues"></a>Ambiguity issues</h2>
        <p>When 2 different properties share the same inbound id for a given station,
 the result upload programs get into trouble because they cannot find out which
 one of both is actually being uploaded. This potential problem is indicated by
 an "&lt;ambiguous&gt;" indication on the corresponding line of the
 station configuration dump.</p>
        <p>To cope with such situations, the result upload functions have some built-in
 assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">If only 1 of the ambiguous properties is scheduled for the given specimen
 on the sending station, it is assumed that one is being uploaded.</li>
            <li value="2">If both are scheduled for the sending station, it is checked if only 1 of
 them has a status &lt; 'Confirmed'. In that case the only value-accepting
 result is assumed.</li>
            <li value="3">If not at all scheduled for the sending station, it is checked if the
 received result is scheduled for another station, in order to find out the
 property.</li>
        </ul>

            <p><span style="color: #003366; font-weight: bold;">Example</span>
            </p>
            <p xmlns=""> Serum &gt; Procedure 1 &gt; Property A &gt; Procedure 1' &gt; Property B</p>
            <div class="indented" xmlns="">
                <p>if "Property B" = positive then CascadeRequest("Property
 A_Repeat")</p>
            </div>
            <p xmlns="">Serum &gt; Procedure 2 &gt; Property A_Repeat &gt; Procedure 2' &gt;
 Property B_R<br /></p>
            <p xmlns="">Property A and A_Repeat both use the same inbound id !&#160;</p>
            <p xmlns="">Originally, only B is requested. When the analyzer sends the A result, the
 property trigger is executed, causing the following situation:</p>
            <div class="indented" xmlns="">
                <p>A: action status 'Ready', result status 'Confirmed'<br />A_R: action status 'Outputting', result status 'Expected'</p>
            </div>
            <p xmlns="">The uploaded result will be stored in the A_R property.</p>
        </div>
