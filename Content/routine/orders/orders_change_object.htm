        <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Order-based function <span class="ui_element">Change object</span> can help to solve issues with duplicate patients.</p>
        <h2><a name="Functionality"></a>Change object</h2>
        <p>Select an order and choose the contextual menu / ribbon item <span class="ui_element">Change object</span>.</p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Update its identity</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>The object editor will be started, in which you can update 
 the identity of the current person, animal, lot...</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Replace by another object</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>This disconnects the object from the order and starts the order 
 entry program where you can assign a new object.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Replace by and merge with another person</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>This option will only be available if the object is of type <span class="ui_element">Person</span> 
 and the user has access rights to the <span class="ui_element">Person.Merge</span> function.&#160; The function allows 
 replacing a temporary patient by its final version.</p>
            <p>The <span class="ui_element">Replace by another object</span> option  has the disadvantage 
 that the temporary patient is only disconnected, and remains in the database 
 where it serves of no more purpose and only pollutes the database.</p>
            <p>With this third option, the <a href="../../configuration/correspondents/persons_search.htm">person search screen</a> appears, from which 
 you can select the right patient. On selection, the original (temporary) 
 patient is merged with the selected one, and hence disappears from the 
 database. So, you end up with the order linked to the right patient and 
 the temporary patient is gone.</p>
            <div class="text_box_notes">
                <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">
                        <p>The <span class="ui_element">Replace by and merge with another person</span> option is typically used to replace a temporary version of 
 a person record by its final one. Most often, the temporary version was 
 created manually because the registration by the HIS wasn't received yet 
 at the time the order was created. This implies that no encounter external 
 id was available either.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is logical to <span class="ui_element">re-determine the encounter</span> for that order. 
 So, after assigning the new patient to the order, the encounter will be 
 determined as if the order was originally entered. </p>
                        <p>After that, the order 
 entry program appears. When pressing OK, the updated encounter information 
 is stored. When pressing cancel, it is undone.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="2">
                        <p>This action is logged and can be viewed for both the Order and the Person 
 via the Log entries.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2><a name="Resend_electronic_reports"></a>Resend electronic reports</h2>
        <p>When changing the object of an order (e.g. address change via Order entry screen), GLIMS will examine the object's orders of the last month and resend any 
 electronic reports for these orders.</p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">When editing 
 the object of an order</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>All orders of the object of the last month will be examined in order 
 to determine if any electronic reports are defined for these orders. </p>
            <p>If 
 this is the case then these electronic reports will be marked with <span class="ui_element">Needs checking</span>
 if they have been sent before. This will cause the reports to be resent.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">When changing 
 the object of an order</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>This will cause all reports for the specific order to be checked for electronic
 reports which have been sent before. If any electronic reports are found 
 then these reports will be resent.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">When merging 
 persons / objects</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>All orders of the last month of both the <span class="ui_element">bad</span> and <span class="ui_element">good</span> 
 object will be examined in order to determine if any electronic reports 
 are defined for these orders.</p>
            <p>If this is the case then these electronic reports will 
 be marked with <span class="ui_element">Needs checking</span> if they have been sent before. 
 This will cause the reports to be resent.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_box_tips">
            <p><span style="color: #C29D0A; font-weight: bold;">Tip</span>
            </p>
            <p>If certain electronic reports should not be marked as <span class="ui_element">Needs checking</span> when an order's object or <a href="../../configuration/encounters/encounters.htm#External">encounter</a> is updated, activate the option <span class="ui_element" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only result changes</span> in their <a href="../../configuration/report_templates/report_templates.htm#Electronic" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">templates</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><a name="Remarks"></a>Changing the object of multiple orders at once</h2>
        <p>This function also works when selecting multiple orders, to allow changing 
the object for multiple orders of the same patient at the same time. The 
following remarks apply in this case:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Only multiple orders of the <b>same object</b> are accepted&#160; </li>
            <li value="2">Since the <span class="ui_element">Replace by and merge with another person</span> option already moves all the orders of the 
 <span class="ui_element">bad</span> patient to the <span class="ui_element">good</span> patient,  selecting multiple orders makes no sense if 
 you intend to use this merge option.&#160; </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>When choosing the <span class="ui_element">Replace by another object</span> option, the selected orders 
 will be disconnected from the original object and shown in the order entry 
 screen one after  the other, in order to allow choosing the correct patient. </p>
                <p>From the second 
 order on, the patient selected for the first order will already be filled in, 
 so in many cases the order entry screen for these orders an simply be closed. 
 The order entry screen is still opened for the second and subsequent orders to 
 allow choosing the correct encounter.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
