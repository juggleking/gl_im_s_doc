        <h1>Order entry: Requests</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This page contains an embedded browser of requests contained in the 
 order. The browser has ten columns, showing for each request: the template 
 type, template mnemonic, root request definition mnemonic, root specimen sequencer, 
 template description, object date and time, urgency, chargeability and 
 billing mark. On top of this browser are widgets used for the creation 
 of new requests.</p>
        <h2>Request selection</h2>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Request</p>
        <p>This field references the root request definition to 
 be used for request creation. </p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Label</p>
        <p>The <span class="ui_element">label</span> of the request field also 
 shows how many requests or root requests (See Details option) are currently 
 in present in the order.&#160;</p>
        <p>Pressing Ctrl-F activates a browser 
 where multiple request definition records can be selected. The same search mechanism 
 can be obtained in the embedded browser of the requests page by hitting 
 the Insert key.&#160;The request definition browser features an <span class="ui_element">Options</span> 
 button to narrow down the number of request definitions in the browser.&#160;&#160;The 
 'type' settings are remembered per user.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><a class="MCPopupThumbnailLink MCPopupThumbnailPopup" href="../requestable_query_options.gif" data-mc-popup-alt=""><img class="MCPopupThumbnail img imgLargeImage" data-mc-width="346" data-mc-height="291" src="../requestable_query_options_thumb_0_120.png" alt="" tabindex="" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>A root request definition is any request definition that is actually used for requesting. 
 If this root request definition is a panel, it will be expanded to its contained 
 panel members, and the browser will show a line for each panel member. 
 Because every line shows the root request definition, you are able to see for 
 each request whether or not it was requested through panel expansion. 
 Each panel member has a sequence number which allows to specify in which 
 order the panel should be requested. This can be important when the panel 
 includes explicit material requests or when the order in the reports depends 
 on the order in which the requests are entered.</p>
        <p>The field next to the <span class="ui_element">Request list</span> field allows the user can enter 
 a discriminator. Subsequently entered requests will inherit this discriminator 
 and will receive a dynamic type corresponding with the discriminator format.&#160;&#160;&#160;This 
 can be useful when several requests with the same dynamic discriminator 
 have to be entered.&#160;For more information, see dynamic test 
 requesting</p>
        <h4>Request syntax</h4>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>The request syntax allows for instance to:</p>
            <p>[-]&lt;rqbl&gt;[=&lt;value&gt;][,[-]&lt;rqbl&gt;[=&lt;value&gt;]]...</p>
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">entering a '-' (minus) in front of the request definition 
	 mnemonic will cause removal of the request definition</li>
                <li value="2">appending '=&lt;value&gt;' to the request definition mnemonic 
	 will assign an initial result value to the request definition (e.g. patient 
	 weight, urinary volume, ...). Note that this kind of result entry 
	 has some drawbacks:</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="indented">
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Although QC-checks are applied, resulting warnings 
	 will be suppressed.</li>
                    <li class="p" value="2">
                        <p style="text-align: left;">The assessment method rejection 
	 limit check can not always be applied since the result has not yet 
	 been scheduled and the assessment method is not yet known.<br /><br />	To cope with this, the result is compared with the minimum and maximum 
	 of the rejection limits of all the enabled assessment methods for 
	 this property.&#160;&#160;When the result lies above or below all 
	 these rejection limits, it is rejected.&#160;&#160;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">Note that no high rejection limit checking 
	 takes place when one of the high rejection limits is unknown.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">In case of panel request definitions:&#160;</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>Typing Panel=Value results in assigning the value to all properties 
 request definitions of that panel (e.g. Diff=Not enough sample). The entered

            <p>Request are ordered as follows: existing requests are grouped per root

            <p>To the right of the request definition spinner are the request <span class="ui_element">object date

 fields.</p>

 in the order entry options and when opening the order entry screen, none 
 of the time and dates are filled in.&#160;GLIMS will then take the 
 system time (as from the database) at the moment the first request is 
 added (date or time not filled in by user).<br /><br />So, the object time taken (when none is specified), is the time the first 
 request for the order is entered. When an order is saved and one enters 
 the first request for the next new order, the object time is reset and 
 the time the first request is entered will be used for the object time.&#160;&#160;&#160;The

        <h3>Dynamic test requesting</h3>
        <p>GLIMS offers several ways to request dynamic test. Please see the chapter <a href="order_entry_discriminator.htm">Requesting tests 
 with a discriminator</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="Dealing with overlapping panels"></a>Dealing with overlapping 
 panels</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, orders contain requests for panels that have common members.&#160;&#160;Requesting 
 these panels is no problem: GLIMS automatically detects that a request 
 is already present and will simply ignore the additional panel member 
 request. However, GLIMS also has to avoid that when deleting 
 a first panel, the members of this panel are not deleted from the order 
 if they are also required for another panel.<br /></p>
        <p>To deal with this situation, the following rules are followed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">During the requesting phase, the program keeps 
	 track of the fact that a test was requested via different panels. 
	 This is also visible by the fact that all requesting panel mnemonics 
	 are shown in the request mnemonic column of the order entry request 
	 browser. When saving the order, this information is saved in the Request.PanelList 
	 field.<br /></li>
            <li value="2">When entering "-X", the program first 
	 checks if "X" was one of the original request definitions used 
	 for this order. If so, then all the requests where the root request definition 
	 mnemonic equals "X" or where "X" appears in the 
	 panel list are treated.&#160;&#160;Deletion of such a request is done 
	 by first removing the "X" from its panel list. The request 
	 will only be removed when its panel list becomes empty.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="text_box_notes" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
            </p>
            <p xmlns="">"MONO" + "DIFF", followed by "-DIFF" 
 will result in an order where MONO is still requested, since it was not 
 requested via the DIFF mnemonic.&#160;&#160;If "X" was not one 
 of the original request definitions, then all the requests of tests, specimens, 
 microbiology action, ... within this panel are removed from the order, 
 regardless of how they where requested and via how many panels they where 
 requested.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
            <p xmlns="">This will allow entering requests like "HEMA" + "-RBC", 
 indicating that the HEMA panel should be requested, except for RBC, or 
 "HEMA" + "-DIFF", indicating that we want the HEMA 
 panel without the DIFF members (even though DIFF was not used in the positive 
 requesting phase). This also implies that entering "-X" where 
 X is not a panel request definition will always result in the removal of the 
 requests where the actual property, material, microbiology procedure, 
 ... corresponds with the one referred to by the "X" request definition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_box_notes" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
            </p>
            <p xmlns="">Deleting a request by pointing to a request in the order 
 entry screen's request browser and deleting it via the "&lt;Delete&gt;" 
 key will result in the removal of the request, regardless of its panel 
 list.</p>
            <p xmlns="">In other words, when deleting via a mnemonic that was used in the requesting 
 phase, only the requests actually requested via this mnemonic are deleted. 
 When deleting via another mnemonic, all requests corresponding with tests 
 represented by the mnemonic are removed, regardless of their original 
 request mnemonic.</p>
        </div>
        <h3><a name="Paired"></a><a name="kanchor93"></a>Paired samples</h3>
        <p>During order entry, you can hit the F9 function key when positioned 
 in the Request field.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>This option allows to add a request for a property which has to be assessed 
 explicitly on an already existing specimen for the same patient (as is 
 often desired in serology/toxicology labs).&#160;&#160;&#160;Although 
 the request is added to the CURRENT order, it will refer to the existing 
 old specimen (which was originally requested for another order).&#160;&#160;&#160;How 
 this is reflected on paper reports mainly depends on the report parameter 
 settings (cf. the ReportTemplate.Grouping field with as interesting values 
 GroupByOrderByDate or GroupByObjectTime).</p>
        <p>By pressing the F9 function key, a browser is displayed on screen showing 
 a list of known results/specimens of the current object of the order.&#160;&#160;It 
 is possible to select the specimen to be reused either from a specimen 
 or result browser. &#160;Your preference can be set with the order entry 
 option <a href="options/order_entry_options_tab_main.htm#Method">Method to select paired 
 specimens</a>.</p>
        <p>Upon selection of one of these specimens or results, the order entry 
 program will automatically impose that all subsequent requests for this 
 order use the selected specimen or the specimen of the selected result 
 as root specimen, without disturbing the LowestObjectTime of the current 
 order.</p>
        <h2>Additional request fields and request browser</h2>
        <h3>Date and time</h3>
        <p>The <span class="ui_element">Object date</span> and <span class="ui_element">time</span> denote an 
 important time to be associated with the result or specimen. We use the 
 qualifier 'Object' because they indicate at which time in the evolution 
 of the object (patient) a snapshot was taken, typically by sampling 
 a specimen from the object. Note the difference between the assessment 
 time of a result and its object time (sampling time): 
 the result can be assessed at any time after sampling, but it stores a 
 property value (RBC count) describing the object at the object time! The 
 object time has to be provided with the result for interpretation, 
 whereas the assessment time is mainly used for logging purposes 
 (GLP accreditation). GLIMS uses the object time of a property assessment 
 request (Na) to make sure that the assessment will be performed on a specimen 
 with a correct matching object time.</p>
        <h3><a name="Urgency"></a>Urgency</h3>
        <p>The <span class="ui_element">Urgency</span> field allows you to choose one of the <a href="order_entry_urgency_duetime.htm">urgency levels</a> defined in the site 
 domain <span class="ui_element">Urgency</span>. If no level is defined, GLIMS defaults to a number range 
 of 1 to 9.</p>
        <h3>Chargeability</h3>
        <p>The <span class="ui_element">Chargeability</span> field can contain either <b>Yes</b> = "charge" or <b>No</b> ="don't 
 charge". It can also be left empty, in which case the <a href="../../../configuration/requestables/requestables.htm">request definition</a>'s 
 chargeability will be applied.</p>
        <h3>Billing mark</h3>
        <p>The <span class="ui_element">Billing 
 mark</span> field allows you to choose one of the (enumeration) values defined in 
 the site domain <a href="../../../modules/billing/tariffication/configuration/billing_marks.htm">BillingMarks</a>.&#160;&#160;You can also specify an <span class="ui_element">Order 
 billing mark (OBM)</span>, i.e. a default billing mark for the entire order. 
 If the latter is specified, this billing mark is used for each request 
 where no explicit billing mark is specified (including requests added 
 later on, e.g. via MISPL). When an order is rewritten and only 1 different 
 billing mark is used in its requests, then the order inherits this billing 
 mark.</p>
        <h3><a name="Request"></a>Request flag</h3>
        <p>The <span class="ui_element">Request flags</span> field allows to indicate 
 that a request was added to the order on the initiative of the lab or 
 on the initiative of the issuer (e.g. ordered by phone). This 
 may have important billing implications. This field behaves 
 a lot like the <span class="ui_element">Billing mark</span> field, but the only possible values currently 
 supported are <b>L</b> to indicate a lab-issued request and <b>I</b>to indicate 
 an issuer-issued request. These values are stored in the Request.Flags 
 field.</p>
        <h3><a name="Request2"></a>Request form</h3>
        <p>The <span class="ui_element">Request 
 form</span> button allows the selection of a <a href="../../../configuration/request_forms/request_forms.htm">request form</a> from which requests can be chosen. </p>
        <h3>contextual menu functions</h3>
        <p> In the request browser, menu functions can be applied to one or more requests. To this aim, select a request (or several requests using the CTRL key), right-click on the selection and choose one of the following functions:</p>
        <h4>Internal comment</h4>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>This function allows to enter comment used for internal purposes (e.g. 
 on work lists).&#160;&#160;&#160;When adding internal comment to a request definition, 
 the request definition type (first column of embedded browser of the request 
 page) is marked with an asterisk and is recognizable as such on the work 
 list.&#160;&#160;You can enter free text or use the Insert key to add 
 a text reference or a text expression.</p>
            <div class="text_box_notes" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
                </p>
                <p>When choosing the function while more than 1 request is selected, GLIMS 
 will ask for a single comment which will be applied to all selected requests.&#160;</p>

        <h4>External comment</h4>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>This function allows to enter comment used for external purposes (on 
 reports). When adding external comment to a request definition, the 
 request definition type (first column of embedded browser of the request page) 
 is marked with an asterisk.&#160;&#160;You can enter free text or use 
 the Insert key to add a text reference or a text expression.</p>
            <div class="text_box_notes" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

        <h2><a name="Property blocking period"></a>Property blocking period and 
 property reusability</h2>
        <h3>Blocking periods</h3>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Fixed blocking period</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>It is possible to specify a so-called 'blocking period' for each property. 
 This is the minimal time span in days that should exist between two requests 
 for the same property and the same patient. This time span can be specified 
 in the Property.BlockingPeriod field.&#160;&#160;Note that the property 
 blocking period check ignores results that were not assessed (i.e. Result.AssessmentCount 
 = 0). This may occur when a result code is applied (e.g. "NM = No 
 material received") with ResultCode.Assessed = NO.</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>The blocking period check is executed against the latest effectively 
 requested and assessed result, ignoring any already blocked requests in 
 between.&#160;Therefore it is necessary that a 'blocked' result 
 can be distinguished from a normal one.&#160;&#160;This has been accomplished 
 by the .Original field referring the original (assessed) result, while 
 the .IsDuplicate field is still = NO. This means: it isn't a copy, but 
 it refers an original result record (that caused the blocking).&#160;</p>
                <p>This also facilitates putting comments on reports.&#160;The previous 
 result can be easily accessed via .Original, as in the following example:</p>
                <div class="text_box_examples" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span style="color: #003366; font-weight: bold;">Example</span>
                    </p>
                    <p xmlns="">DateTimeToString(.Original.ObjectTime, "%x %H:%M")</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text_box_notes">
                <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
                </p>
                <p>When an existing result within the blocking period is detected during 
 order entry:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li value="1">For <span class="ui_element">explicitly requested</span> properties, if a blocking period applies,<ul><li value="1">A question will appear in manual order entry (The user is offered the possibility to ignore this and create 
 a new request, reject the request, or accept the blocking period and create 
 a result with a message in its value to warn the issuer about this. In 
 the latter case, the result's value is filled with the text in Property.BlockingPeriodMessage 
 (or with a fixed text when not specified), and is validated automatically 
 without being scheduled.&#160;The new request will be created with 
 ToCharge = NO.). </li><li value="2">In electronic order entry, the result is automatically blocked.</li></ul></li>
                    <li value="2">For <span class="ui_element">implicitly requested</span> properties, if a blocking period applies,<ul><li value="1">The result is automatically blocked.</li></ul></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>GLIMS also supports decimal values such as "0.5" (half day) 
 as blocking period. &#160;</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Calculated blocking period</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>It is also possible to define a variable blocking period for each property.&#160;&#160;The 
 blocking period could for instance be different for general practitioners 
 and specialists.&#160;&#160;To support this, you can use the field "Calculate 
 blocking period" for properties.&#160;&#160;This field allows
specifying an Order-based, Integer-valued MISPL expression.&#160;&#160;If 
 the MISPL expression returns an integer, the latter will be considered 
 as the blocking period.&#160;&#160;If the MISPL expression returns a "?", 
 the fixed blocking period will be used (RETURN StringToInteger(?);).</p>
            <p>GLIMS also supports decimal values such as "0.5" (half day) 
 as blocking period. &#160;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_box_notes">
            <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
            </p>
            <p>When adding a request to an order, GLIMS will only consider<span class="ui_element">Available</span> specimens when checking if the blocking period is respected.</p>
            <p>This implies that it is possible to request a request code multiple times for the same object within the defined blocking period, as long as the specimens on which the requests are scheduled are not available yet.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Result reuse</h3>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Result re-usability<br /></p>
        <p>When the existing request also lies within the property's re-usability 
 period, a chance is offered to reuse this existing result. In this case, 
 a warning about the blocking period is added to the Reuse dialog shown 
 to the user. In the Reuse dialog, just as in the Blocking Period dialog, 
 it is also possible to completely cancel the request (except when the 
 request is automatically added via the scheduling process, e.g. as input 
 for a calculated result).</p>
        <p>When a result is reused and the new field Property.ReusabilityComment has 
 a value, this text will be added to the duplicate result's external comment, 
 thus allowing to indicate the reuse of an existing result on the report.</p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Practical example</p>
