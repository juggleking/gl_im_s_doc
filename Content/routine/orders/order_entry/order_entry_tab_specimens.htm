        <h1>Order entry - Specimens</h1>
        <p>In this page, all root specimens of the order are shown via their internal 
 id, external id, material mnemonic, together with a material variable, 
 an Info field and the fields Specimen.HasSibling, Specimen.Status and Specimen.Discriminator.</p>
        <p>The first column contains a sequence number.&#160;&#160; This specimen 
 sequence number is also repeated in the Request page, indicating which 
 request is associated with which root specimen.&#160; Existing requests 
 are grouped per root specimen, headed by the root specimen itself; newly 
 typed in requests are displayed on top. </p>
        <p>The specimen page is especially useful for labs which immediately receive 
 the specimens together with the order, and who explicitly want to confirm 
 these specimens and connect them to a number of property requests.</p>
        <p>To this effect, the Specimen page has a fill-in allowing to enter (or 
 scan) a specimen bar code. Once a new bar code has been entered, a new 
 specimen is added in the specimen browser, displaying the scanned bar 
 code and a default material (as specified by the material request definition 
 having "Defaultmaterial" as mnemonic). The material mnemonic, 
 HasSibling and Discriminator members in the browser can be modified manually.</p>
        <p>The bar code will later be stored in the InternalId member.</p>
        <p>When specimens have been entered this way, or when the RequestByRootSpecimen 
 option in the Order Entry Options screen has been set, the following happens 
 when a new property request is added in the Request page: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">First the program checks whether it can find a procedure 
 chain in the Procedure class which connects one of the scanned root specimen 
 materials to the requested property. If so, the request is accepted and 
 automatically connected to the corresponding root specimen. If no such 
 specimen is found, the program issues a warning and the request is not 
 accepted. Note that the rejection of the request is not done when the 
 property request immediately receives a result via the ‘Request=Value’ 
 syntax. </li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">After a request has been accepted, its root specimen 
 can be modified by using the right-hand mouse button in the request browser. 
 </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is also possible to manually change the internal id of a root specimen 
 by use of the contextual menu function <i>Change internal id</i> while the 
 focus is on the root specimen browser. The newly entered internal id is 
 checked for uniqueness.</p>
        <h2><a name="Variable"></a>Variable and Info cells</h2>
        <p>The <span class="ui_element">Variable</span> and <span class="ui_element">Info</span> cells can be filled in directly in the grid. The entered data is registered in the database when the order is saved.</p>
        <p>Note that only the first material variable can be entered directly in the <span class="ui_element">Variable</span> cell. If there are more variables, they must be specified using the <span class="ui_element">Specimen variable</span> editor. To open this editor, use the contextual menu function <span class="ui_element">Specimen variables</span> on the corresponding specimen.</p>
        <div class="text_box_warnings">
            <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Warning</span>
            </p>
            <p>The data specified in the editor and that entered directly in the grid are not synchronized. Changes made in the grid will override changes made in the editor if the later have not been saved (via click on <span class="ui_element">OK</span> in the editor and then in the order entry screen).</p>
            <p>To avoid mistakes and thus wrong results, please enter material variables and information using either the grid or the editor but not both.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><a name="Specimen"></a>Specimen scope</h2>
        <p>When requesting several tests that can be executed on the same specimen, you
can choose whether the action
scheduler should create a new specimen record rather than reusing another
specimen of the same order (but which for instance will be used on another
station).</p>
        <p>The following fields are used to implement this "specimen scope
concept":</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p class="fieldlabel">Procedure.SpecimenScope</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>Each procedure explicitly defines its own specimen
 scope.</p>
                <div class="text_box_notes">
                    <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is not recommended that procedures with an isolation test as output have a specimen scope. If they do and the Procedure.SpecimenScope differs from the Specimen.Scope, the procedure will never be scheduled.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="fieldlabel">MicrobiologyProcedure.SpecimenScope</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <p> Each procedure explicitly defines its own specimen
 scope.<br /></p>
            </div>
            <p class="fieldlabel">PathologyProcedure.SpecimenScope</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>Each procedure explicitly defines its own specimen
 scope.   &#160;&#160;</p>
            </div>
            <p class="fieldlabel">Specimen.Scope</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>When a procedure requires a specimen, the newly created specimen
 inherits the procedure's scope. Another procedure requiring the same material can
 only reuse this specimen when Procedure.SpecimenScope and Specimen.Scope match.</p>
                <div class="text_box_notes">
                    <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>A procedure can reuse a specimen even though Procedure.SpecimenScope and Specimen.Scope do not match provided that no procedure exists with an empty specimen scope or with the same scope as the specimen.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text_box_examples" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span style="color: #003366; font-weight: bold;">Example</span>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">If you do not want to reuse a specimen if it is to be used on
several stations, you should define a different specimen scope for each
procedure that uses a different station.</li>
                    <li value="2">If you request two microbiology/pathology procedures (or a combination of regular 
procedures and microbiology/pathology procedures) which would normally be able to use the 
same specimen, you can indicate that each procedure requires its own specimen by 
defining a different specimen scope for each procedure.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>When this mechanism is used, an order can easily contain several specimen
requests of the same material. The field ProcedureOutput.Shareable may be of
help to indicate that a specimen sampling or specimen distribution procedure can
produce several specimens of the same material (otherwise there will as many
sampling actions as there are root specimen requests).</p>
