 -&gt; Including files in object data sheet and text reports</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1"><a href="#Introduction">Introduction</a>
            </li>

            </li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="3"><a href="#Purpose">Purpose</a>
            </li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="4"><a href="#In%20the%20object%20data%20sheet">In the object 
 data sheet</a>
            </li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="5"><a href="#In%20text%20reports">In text reports</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Both in the <a href="../configuration/objects/objects_data_sheet.htm">object 
 data sheet</a> text and in <a href="../routine/reports/index_reports.htm">text 
 reports</a>, it is possible to insert an external file.&#160; This file 
 should of course exist and be accessible from the executing computer (the 
 client for the object data sheets and the client or the server for text 
 reports).&#160; Moreover, it is possible to have this file automatically 
 deleted after it has been included.</p>
        <h2><a name="Syntax"></a>Syntax</h2>
        <p>Including a file can be done by introducing in the text module itself 
 an indication of the following format:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>&lt;FILE SRC=xxx &gt;&#160;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>in which 'xxx' is the path of the file, either the full path name or 
 a relative path name (in which case PROPATH will be searched for the file). 
 If the file is to be deleted after it has been included you should use 
 the syntax:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>&lt;FILE SRC=xxx DEL=YES&gt;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2><a name="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The original reason why this functionality was created is to allow some 
 MISPL methods to create very large text output.&#160; As MISPL itself 
 has a 4kb output limit, this functionality allows saving its output text 
 into a (temporary) file and specify the pathname of this file.&#160; After 
 this temporary file has been included into the text, it is simply deleted 
 again.&#160; Example: <a href="../modules/microbiology/mispl/object_m_microbiology_history.htm">Object.MicrobiologicHistory()</a></p>
        <h2><a name="In the object data sheet"></a>In the object data sheet</h2>
        <p>There is no restriction with respect to the type and size of the file 
 that is included, as long as the total text is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">A plain text file&#160;</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">A HTML or XML file that can be viewed with a normal 
 web browser (so in this case the included file might contain HTML or XML).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="In text reports"></a>In text reports</h2>
        <p>A file can be included in a <a href="../configuration/property_classifications/property_classifications.htm">property 
 classification node</a>.&#160; As long as the total size of the paragraph 
 (including the file) does not exceed 30kB, the file is included in the 
 current paragraph.&#160; If not, new paragraphs with a maximum size of 
 30kB will be created.&#160; These added paragraphs will have the same 
 settings as the original paragraph, but with PageBreakBefore=NO.&#160; 
 In that case the original paragraph will have 'KeepWithNext=Yes' if it 
 had 'KeepLinesToGether=Yes'.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor251"></a>File inclusion is also possible in the <a href="../configuration/report_templates/report_templates.htm">headers 
 and footers</a> of the report, but with the restriction that the file 
 is always included in the current section and that no additional sections 
 can be created if the file is too large.</p>
