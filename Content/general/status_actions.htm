        <h1>Introduction to actions and action states</h1>
        <p>Actions are the actual realizations of procedures. At order entry the 
 scheduling takes place, which means that GLIMS is looking for an appropriate 
 procedure to meet the requests. At that time, actions are created.</p>
        <h3>An action can have several states:</h3>
        <h4>Connecting</h4>
        <p><a name="kanchor275"></a>This status implies that the action has just been created. Inputs and 
 outputs are not yet available. This status will normally not be visible 
 in the user interface.</p>
        <h4>Inputting</h4>
        <p>This status implies that the action is waiting for the inputs: some specimen inputs are not available yet or some result inputs have not been confirmed yet.</p>
        <p>It may 
 be possible that an action does not have any inputs. In the case of sampling 
 for example, there are only outputs. In the latter case, the status of 
 such an action will automatically be passed to the next stage (Pending).</p>
        <h4>Pending</h4>
        <p><a name="kanchor276"></a>An action is pending when the result input(s) or specimen input(s) are 
 available. E.g. an analyzer knows that the material is available but is 
 waiting for a signal to start the action. When the Autostart field of 
 the corresponding procedure is activated, no start signal is required, 
 and the action status will automatically be set to Outputting.</p>
        <p><u style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Aim of this status:</i></u>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">It allows to indicate an actual start date for this 
 action. </li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">As long as an action is in status Pending, new outputs 
 can be added. The action will be set to Outputting, if it is added to 
 work list (sent to an analyzer).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><u style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Practical example:</i></u>
        </p>
        <p>A Diff panel is requested at order entry:</p>
        <p>The Diff procedure will have EDTA as input and Eosinophiles (EO), Basophiles,... 
 as outputs. Due to the activated Autostart field, the Diff procedure will 
 automatically be set to Outputting. It is possible that e.g. EO cannot 
 be measured on an analyzer. A MISPL function or trigger will activate 
 a cascade request for this output. As the procedure had already obtained 
 the status Outputting, no new outputs can be added. Therefore a new action 
 (Manual Diff) will be created. In order to avoid several new actions for 
 each property that could not be assessed, the status of the new action 
 will be set to Pending, which allows to add new outputs. When generating 
 a worklist for this manual Diff action, the status will be changed to 
 Outputting.</p>
        <h4>Outputting</h4>
        <p>When an action is set to Outputting, it is actually being processed.</p>
        <p>An action obtains the status Outputting if </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">The AutoStart field of the procedure is enabled. 
 In that case the 'Pending' status is simply skipped; </li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">The first result is entered, either manually or via 
 analyzer;</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="3">The action is put on a work list;</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="4">Manually, via 'Start' method on Action.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consequences: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">Result and specimen outputs automatically receive 
 status 'Expected'; </li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">No additional outputs can be assigned or added to 
 the Action (train has left). This implies that an ancillary examination 
 will generate a new Action, and cause an extra line on the worklist; </li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="3">Standard results are entered and formulas calculated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Partial</h4>
        <p>An action becomes Partial, if at least one result output or specimen 
 output&#160; is available.</p>
        <h4>Realized</h4>
        <p>All result and specimen outputs are available, but they have not yet 
 been confirmed.</p>
        <h4><a name="Ready"></a>Ready</h4>
        <p>All results are confirmed, validated or discontinued and all materials 
 are available or discontinued; or there are no outputs.</p>
        <h3>Fields which have an influence on the normal status sequence:</h3>
        <p>The <i><b>Autostart field</b></i> of the procedure: If set, 
 the <i>Pending</i> status will be skipped.</p>
        <p>The <i><b>Autologin field</b></i> of the material output: 
 When an action becomes <i>Outputting</i>, the Specimen becomes <i>Expected</i>. 
 When the specimen is <i>Available</i>, the specimen input will automatically 
 become <i>Available</i> and therefore the action becomes <i>Pending</i>. 
 If the Autostart field is active, the action will be set to <i>Outputting</i>. 
 As a consequence the Specimen output becomes <i>Expected</i>. In order 
 to avoid that one has to indicate manually that the specimen output will 
 also become <i>Available</i> (which naturally is the case), the Autologin 
 field should be enabled.</p>
        <p>If a material output has automatically been set to <i>Available</i> 
 by means of the Autologin function, the contextual menu function Unconfirm 
 (on the material table) can no longer be activated.</p>
