        <p>One of the prime objectives of laboratories is to ensure that laboratory 
 quality-control practices are sufficient to achieve satisfactory analytical 
 quality.</p>
        <p>Internal quality control is the process of controlling the quality of 
 assessment methods. In a stricter sense, the term refers to specific statistical 
 methods applied to results obtained from special materials. Quality control 
 lots (characterized by a material code and a lot number) have stable properties. 
 They are intended for use in monitoring the accuracy and precision of 
 specific quality control parameters. Internal quality control (IQC) checks 
 whether property evaluations on quality control materials are reproducible.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Statistics (a well-known set of simple 
 statistical rules are Westgard rules) determine whether the successive 
 results for a given property on a given material show any unexpected changes. 
 If they do, a QC alarm condition is raised. It can also prevent automatic 
 release of routine results depending on the QC check passing. There should 
 be some mechanism to define which routine results are ’rescoped’ to the 
 QC check.</p>
        <p>Quality control is based on property assessment on objects with <i>known 
 characteristics</i>. These objects are QC products, supplied with specifications 
 from the manufacturer. In GLIMS, QC products are stored as objects of 
 type QC Lot. As each QC lot might be used for reference assessments of 
 different properties, the respective results and statistics are gathered 
 in different populations. A population consists of an entire set of results. 
 Each population is associated with a QC lot and with an assessment method. 
 On each population, specific QC checks can be scheduled. The results of 
 these checks can influence the reliability status of the associated assessment 
 method. For each of those, a corresponding class is defined. All are subtypes 
 of the general QCCheck class which references the QCPopulation class. 
 The WestgardCheck class supports cross checking between populations.</p>
