        <p>When GLIMS does the automatic <a href="isolations_series.htm">detection 
 of isolation doubles</a>, GLIMS will group identical isolations (of the 
 same patient) together in a so-called 'Isolation series'. At the same 
 time GLIMS will also look if the isolation series can be grouped with 
 one or more other isolation series (of other patients). If this is the 
 case, a 'Hospital infection' will be created, grouping all these related 
 isolation series together.</p>
        <p>All information regarding possibly related infections is stored in 2 
 fields:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

	 period).<br />	&#160;&#160;</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">'Toward' : contains same information as 'From',

        </p>
        <p>The conditions that must be fulfilled to link 2 isolation series together, 
 are (all parameters can be set in 'System management -&gt; Customize -&gt; 
 <a href="../microbiology/configuration/microbiology_general_options.htm">GLIMS

            <li value="5"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Time/place matching</b>:<br /><br />	For the detection of cross infections, isolation series are considered 
	 to continue till the end of the patient's encounter.&#160; 
	When 2 patients have stayed in the same ward, and 
	 for one of these patients (patient A) an isolation was detected *before* 
	 both patients were in the same ward, it can still be detected as a 
	 cross infection (from patient A to B), even *after* the last isolation 
	 was detected, as long as that isolation was detected during the same 
	 encounter of that patient (A). 
	The reason is that we assume that after an isolation 
	 has been detected, it does not just disappear immediately after. The 
	 micro-organism is assumed to reside in the patient until the end of 
	 the encounter.</li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The cross infection detection mechanism does not use the option 
	 "Maximum number of days between 2 consecutive isolations of a 
	 series". Instead, the mechanism goes back as far as the beginning 
	 of the patients' admission to the hospital, to find possible causing 
	 cross infections (contamination sources).&#160; </p>
                <p>If several hospitalized encounters are valid at the same time for 
	 the same patient, only the most recent one is considered as valid 
	 (the most recently started, or -if the start time is the same- the 
	 most recently created one). The others are ignored.</p>
                <p>When several stays within an encounter have same the start time, 
	 only the most recently created one is considered as valid.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <li value="6">For isolation series (infections), the field '<b>Hospital acquired</b>', 
	 is automatically set to Yes or No according to the parameter '<b>Maximum 
	 number of days between admission and hospital acquired</b>' in the 
	 <a href="../microbiology/configuration/microbiology_general_options.htm">microbiology 
	 specific settings</a> and/or in the microorganism 'Epidemiology' settings.&#160;&#160;The 
	 field is set by the function 'Determine infection'. 
	<p>Example: if the "<b>Maximum number of days between admission 
	 and hospital acquired" </b>is set to "3" and a patient 
	 enters on 01/01/2008 then an isolation detected on 02/01/2008 will 
	 NOT be considered as "hospital acquired".</p><p>Only isolation series of which the option "hospital acquired" 
	 is enabled are considered during the detection of <a href="#" class="selected">hospital 
	 infections</a>.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The following detection parameters can also be specified per micro-organism 
 or micro-organism family:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">Maximum antibiogram difference between 2 consecutive 
	 isolations&#160;</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">Maximum total antibiogram difference between first 
	 and last isolation of a series</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="3">Maximum number of days between admission and hospital 
	 acquired</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means that each parameter that is specified for a certain microorganism 
 is automatically inherited by all descendant microorganisms.&#160;</p>
        <h3>Detection of cross infections caused by ambulatory patients</h3>
        <p>If an isolation was detected for patient A while he was not hospitalized 
 (so during an ambulatory encounter), and afterwards he is hospitalized 
 and stays in the same ward as patient B (for which the same micro-organism 
 is also detected), then Glims is able to detect this as a cross infection.</p>
        <p>This is not the default behaviour however.&#160;&#160;To obtain this, 
 the following configuration is required:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">In the general microbiology options (Start -&gt; Microbiology -&gt; 
	 Configuration -&gt; Settings):&#160;&#160;a field named "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Infection lag before encounter</span>" 
	 is available. With this option, you can specify how 
	 many days Glims should look back in time (before the start of the 
	 hospitalized encounter), while searching for isolations of patient 
	 A *before* patient A was hospitalized. (default period = 0 days)<br />	&#160; </li>
            <li value="2">In the micro-organism configuration screen: the same option is 
	 available, so that it is possible to override the general value and 
	 vary the value of this period according to the micro-organism or family. 
	 This option is also inherited by all micro-organisms below it (in 
	 the tree).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Automatic warning"></a>Automatic warning</h2>
        <p>GLIMS provides the possibility of being informed automatically of the 
 fact that a hospital infection has been detected, or that a known hospital 
 infection expands. For this you can set a '<b>Infection trigger</b>' in 
 'System management -&gt; Settings -&gt; GLIMS microbiology'.</p>
        <p>This trigger is executed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">When a hospital infection is detected the first 
	 time.</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">Whenever a new isolation series (for some other 
	 patient) is added to an existing hospital infection.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Cross infections"></a>Cross infections</h2>
        <p>The function 'Determine infections' also creates a '<b>Cross-infection</b>' 
 record as a link between different infections (Isolation series) of different 
 patients that were in the same ward in the same period. They can be viewed 
 from an 'Isolation series' with the contextual menu functions '<b>Possibly 
 caused by</b>' and '<b>Possibly transmitted toward</b>'.</p>
        <p>Glims also offers a trigger that runs each time a cross infection is 
 created.&#160;&#160;This <b>cross infection trigger </b>can be specified 
 in the general microbiology options (Start -&gt; System management -&gt; 
 Customize -&gt; Glims microbiology).&#160;&#160;The defined MISPL expression 
 must have "CrossInfection" as base table.&#160;&#160;The main 
 advantage that the cross infection trigger has over the "Infection 
 trigger" is that more information is available: from patient, to 
 patient, via ward, via room etc.&#160; </p>
        <h2><a name="Cross_infection_requires_antibiogram"></a>Cross infection requires 
 antibiogram</h2>
        <p>It is possible to define that GLIMS should only create cross infections 
 when both the source and target infection have an antibiogram. &#160;This 
 can be specified on two levels:</p>
        <h4>General setting</h4>
        <p>In the general settings (Start -&gt; System management -&gt; Customize 
 -&gt; GLIMS microbiology), the option "Antibiogram required for cross 
 infections" allows to indicate that GLIMS should not create cross 
 infections between 2 infections if both do not have reportable antibiotic 
 results.</p>
        <h4>Per micro-organism</h4>
        <p>If for certain micro-organism (families), an exception should be made 
 to the general setting, the micro-organism option "Antibiogram required 
 for cross infections" can be used. &#160;The setting of this option 
 will be inherited by all underlying micro-organisms.</p>
        <p>Possible values:</p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">YES</p>
        <p class="fielddescription">For this microorganism (and all underlying 
 organisms) GLIMS will only create cross infections when antibiograms are 
 available for source and target infection.</p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">NO</p>
        <p class="fielddescription">For this microorganism (and all underlying 
 organisms) GLIMS will create cross infections even when no antibiograms 
 are available for source and target.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">?</p>
        <p class="fielddescription">When left unknown, the value is inherited from 
 the parent microorganism family to which it belongs. &#160;When no parent 
 is available, &#160;the general setting is applied.</p>
