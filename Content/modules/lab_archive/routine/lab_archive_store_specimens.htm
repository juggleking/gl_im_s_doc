            <MadCap:concept term="Lab archive" />Lab archive - Storing specimens</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>GLIMS offers different ways to store a specimen in an archive: by scanning 
 the specimen, via MISPL or through analyzer communication.</p>
        <h2>Via Specimen scan</h2>
        <p>The <a href="../../../routine/specimens/specimens_scan.htm">specimen 
 archive scan</a> program makes use of the Lab archive tables like Archive, 
 ArchivePart, RackType, Rack, and ItemStorage. This occurs automatically 
 <b>when a station is selected which refers to a lab archive</b>.</p>
        <h3>Rack lookup</h3>
        <p>When selecting a rack in the specimen scan program (by scanning or entering 
 its code), its archive part mnemonic and rack usage fields are shown next 
 to the specimen barcode field as additional information.</p>
        <p>Using the <a href="../configuration/lab_archive_configuration.htm#Last">Last used rack</a> field of a lab archive (field that 
 is automatically filled), the specimen scan program will by default propose 
 the last rack scanned for this archive.</p>
        <p>If the rack code is specified, the scan program will check if the rack refers 
 to the lab archive for which you are currently scanning (by checking the 
 Rack.Archive field) in order to determine the rack in GLIMS. This 
 implies each rack where Rack.Archive refers to the current archive can 
 be chosen in the specimen scan program, regardless of its rack type! In 
 other words, any rack can be chosen for any archive, providing it has 
 not already been reserved for another archive.</p>
        <p>To allow this, the role of the rack code is very important. The 
 rack code must be specified. When necessary, it is automatically 
 filled with Rack.SeqNo. The rack string entered in the specimen 
 scan program is used to find a rack with a matching code. The 
 sequence number of a rack is not taken into account when looking up a 
 rack via the specimen scan program. Only the rack "code" and 
 "archive" fields, together with a possible check on the rack 
 usage, are used to find a rack.</p>
        <p>The rack usage allows to reserve the use of a number of racks for a 
 special purpose (e.g. a study). When the user is filling a 
 rack with a specific usage in the specimen scan program, the next rack 
 proposed will be a rack with the same usage.</p>
        <p>When the rack is found, the Rack.Type.Capacity is used as default value 
 for the current rack capacity (as opposed to the Station.RunCapacity).</p>
        <h3>Rack position lookup</h3>
        <p>Once the rack has been determined, the specimen scan program
 searches for a free position in that rack. If you enter the code 
 of a rack which still contains specimens (according to the ItemStorage 
 table), the following happens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">If the most recent specimen in the rack is older 
	 than the storage period, you are asked whether the entire rack should be cleared. If the answer is YES, the rack is cleared, otherwise, 
	 you will not be allowed to use this rack. To determine 
	 the storage period of a rack, GLIMS looks in the following fields: 
	 Rack.StoragePeriod, ArchivePart.StoragePeriod and Archive.StoragePeriod. 
	 When a field does not contain a value, the next one is tried.</li>
            <li value="2">If the specimen is less than StoragePeriod days 
	 old, you are asked whether you want to keep filling this rack. If you answer 
	 YES you can continue with this rack. This 
	 message can be suppressed by deactivating the specimen scan option 
	 <a href="../../../routine/specimens/specimens_scan.htm#One">One rack per day</a>.</li>
            <li value="3">By default, the specimen scan program proposes 
	 the position following the highest taken position in the rack. However, 
	 if the <a href="../configuration/lab_archive_configuration.htm#Use">Use first free position</a> option of the rack type 
	 is enabled, the first free position of a rack will be used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The rack can be alphanumeric. Of course, in this case, automatic incrementation 
 of the rack number is no longer performed.</p>
        <h3>Archive reasons</h3>
        <p>The fields <span class="ui_element">Archive reason</span> and <span class="ui_element">Archive sub reason</span> become 
 active when <span class="ui_element">Save into</span> is set to <span class="ui_element">Storage location</span>. These two fields are filled with gp_text mnemonics starting with "ARCH-" 
 and "ARCH-S-". The latter two prefixes are stripped 
 when displayed in the specimen scan program (example above: "reason 1" 
 and "subreason1"). The actual text modules must be based on the Specimen 
 table. </p>
        <p>If the <span class="ui_element">Automatic</span> option (<span class="ui_element">Options</span> tab) is enabled, you will have to select the archive 
 (sub) reason before entering the barcode. It is also possible to query 
 on these two specimen scan fields in order to obtain a list of specimens 
 archived with a specific code.</p>
        <h2>Via MISPL</h2>
        <p>GLIMS also allows storing a specimen in an archive or looking up a stored 
 specimen via MISPL.</p>
        <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Specimen.GetStorage(ArchiveMnemonic, Usage)</b>
        </p>
        <div class="indented">This MISPL function returns a reference to a storage record for this 
 specimen, referring to a rack of the specified archive and usage.</div>
        <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Specimen.SetStorage(Override, ArchiveMnemonic, 
 Usage, CodePattern, Reason)</b>
        </p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>Allows creating an item storage record for this specimen in a rack for 
 the specified Archive and Usage.</p>
            <p>The CodePattern wild card may be used to enhance the rack specification. 
 If a free position in such a rack can be found, an item storage record 
 is created for this specimen. </p>
            <p>The Override parameter allows indicating if an already existing 
 item storage record for this specimen, archive and rack usage should be 
 replaced (instead of being reused). Possible values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">YES : delete old storage record (for same archive) and create new one</li>
                <li value="2">NO : if old storage record (for same archive) exists, do nothing 
 (leave it).</li>
                <li value="3">? : ignore and leave existing storage records (if any) and add 
 a new one.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The last rack chosen via this MISPL function is remembered in the item 
 storage record, in order to continue where it left of upon the next call.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel"><span lang="EN-US">Specimen.Attribute("IsolationStorageList")</span>
        </p>
        <p class="fielddescription">Returns 
 a list containing â€“for each storage record of each isolation on the specimen- the 
 archive, the rack and the position in the rack.</p>
        <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Material.CreationTrigger</b>
        </p>
        <div class="indented">The field Material.CreationTrigger refers to a Specimen-based, Logical-valued 
 site function which is executed whenever a specimen for this material 
 is created. A typical use would be to use the Specimen.SetStorage() function 
 to assign an archive position to the specimen.</div>
        <h2>Via analyzer communication</h2>
        <p>When a station that refers a lab archive sends an archive message (e.g. 
 a Sample Aliquotter), the station communication program will try to create 
 an ItemStorage record connecting the specimen and the rack corresponding 
 to the specified positions.</p>
        <p>To determine the rack, the following hierarchy is used:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">The rack with the same code belonging to an archive (through the 
	 Rack.Archive field)</li>
            <li value="2">If a rack is found with the same code that is not yet assigned 
	 to an archive, this rack will be used and the rack will automatically 
	 be assigned to the archive (through the Rack.Archive field)</li>
            <li value="3">If a rack is found with the same code but it is already reserved 
	 for another archive, an error will be produced.</li>
        </ol>
