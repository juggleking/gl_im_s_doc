        <h1><a name="aanchor3428"></a>
            <MadCap:concept term="Genetics" />Approaches - Introduction and work flows</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Approaches are the instantiations of <a href="../../config/approach_plans/a_p_introduction.htm">approach plans</a> in routine: when an approach plan is <a href="../genetic_exam/g_e_screen.htm#Approach2">selected</a> to analyse a specimen of a genetic exam, an Approach record is automatically created.</p>
        <h2>Basic approach work flow</h2>
        <p>The basic work flow is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Approach plans have been configured.</li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>In order entry, a genetic procedure and a specimen are requested.</p>
                <p>--&gt; a genetic exam is created.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>An approach plan that is suitable for the analysis of the specimen is selected (automatically or manually).</p>
                <p>--&gt; an approach is  created automatically.</p>
                <div class="text_box_notes">
                    <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>The procedure and specimen requests needed to execute the approach are not added to the order yet. They are added as the approach goes when activities start.&#160;This is described <a href="#Work">below</a>.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li value="4">The specimen is set to <span class="ui_element">Available</span>.</li>
            <li value="5">The approach starts automatically.</li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>GLIMS follows the steps defined in the approach. Each approach step,  i.e. each approach activity and transition, is executed in the order dictated by the approach.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">The approach is complete once all the required activities that had to be executed have reached status <span class="ui_element">Finished</span> and the End node is finished.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The following pages describe</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">the <a href="approaches_browser_and_editor.htm">Approach and Approach-related browsers and editors</a>.</li>
            <li value="2">the <a href="approaches_screen.htm">visual representation of approaches and the information that allow you to follow an ongoing approach</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Work"></a>Work flow of procedure activities</h2>
        <p>The main approach steps, activities of type <span class="ui_element">Procedure</span>, are themselves composed of several steps. These steps are described here in general terms.</p>
        <p>When an <a href="approaches_screen.htm#Activiti2">approach activity</a> of type <span class="ui_element">Procedure</span> starts,</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">an action is created.&#160;It instantiates the procedure linked to the approach plan activity.</li>
            <li value="2">the locus requests <a href="../../config/approach_plans/a_p_screen.htm#Requeste">configured</a> on the approach plan activity are added to the genetic exam.</li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>the inputs of the procedure linked to the activity are created. For this, GLIMS looks in the approach for all the results and specimens that can be linked as inputs to the activity's action. </p>
                <p>First, GLIMS&#160;looks in the approach for specimen inputs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">GLIMS must find at least one specimen input for the action to be created.&#160;However, GLIMS need not find a specimen for each material input configured on the procedure.</li>
                    <li value="2">if the option <a href="../../config/approach_plans/a_p_screen.htm#Duplicat">Duplicate by specimen</a> is activated in the editor of the approach plan activity, an action is created for each specimen that GLIMS&#160;finds. For each of the specimens in the action, there is an output.</li>
                    <li value="3">if the <span class="ui_element">Duplicate by specimen</span> option is not activated, the activity becomes a "pooling" activity, i.e. an activity with several specimen inputs linked to a single action, which in turn will result in a single output.</li>
                    <li value="4">if there are also result inputs linked to the action, GLIMS only selects specimens that are input of actions whose output can be used for these result inputs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then, GLIMS looks in the approach for result inputs and links them to the action: a result input R can only be linked to the action if  GLIMS finds, in the same approach, a specimen that is input of an action of which this result R is an output. In other words, a property input configured on the procedure only becomes a result input of the action if there is a specimen on which this result can be assessed.</p>
                <div class="text_box_notes">
                    <p><span style="color: #616E14; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>To sum up, specimen and result inputs of actions are not added to the order: they are supposed to have already been requested, or obtained from previous activities in the approach.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>the outputs of the procedure linked to the activity are added to the order.&#160;More precisely, specimens are added for material outputs and results are added for property outputs. </p>
                <p>In the case of pooling activities all the specimen and result outputs are linked to the same action.&#160;One of the specimen inputs is chosen randomly as parent specimen for the outputs.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
