        <h1><a name="aanchor3467"></a>
            <MadCap:concept term="Billing" /><a name="kanchor332"></a>Who is involved in the billing process ?</h1>
        <p>It is important to make a distinction between the type of a correspondent 
 in GLIMS and the role that will be played in the in an order. In this 
 context, we will be speaking about the <b>role</b> of a correspondent. 
 Example: an issuer (<b>role!</b>) does not always need to be 
 a HC Provider (<b>Type</b>).</p>
        <p>The Order set determination ERD gives an overview of all correspondents 
 involved. Below you fill find a detailed description of this ERD.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor333"></a>As you can see in the figure, the different 'correspondents' are introduced 
 at different phases of the tariffication process. Each of these 'roles' 
 can be selected as a reimburser (via the the reimburser type specified 
 in the policy clause).</p>
        <h3>Correspondent roles at order entry level</h3>
        <p>An order always has an object, which can be a person (patient), a lot 
 or an animal. These three correspondent types are respectively linked 
 to an <b>object person</b>, an <b>object supplier</b> 
 and an <b>object owner</b>, which represent their role in the 
 order.</p>
        <p>If a patient is hospitalized, there will be an encounter which is linked 
 to an <b>institution</b>.</p>
        <p>An order also has an <b>issuer</b> and an agent (<b>order 
 agent</b>).</p>
        <h3>Correspondent roles introduced at order set determination level</h3>
        <p>An order set is also linked to an agent: the billing agent. (this might 
 no longer be supported in the future)</p>
        <p>An order set can have a <b>dispatching lab</b> and <b>must</b> 
 have a <b>receiving lab</b>. By means of the field <i>Party 
 type,</i> it is possible to select a <b>reimbursement party.</b> 
 The party type is one of the six correspondents specified at order level 
 (object person, object supplier, object owner, institution, issuer, order 
 agent) or can also be <b>Specific Instance</b>. In the latter 
 case, the correspondent must be entered manually.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor334"></a>The order set party is not necessarily the one that must pay. It is 
 the correspondent who determines how the billing will be executed by means 
 of its payment agreement. A payment agreement can have a specific party, 
 which will then be the same party of the order set. However, it is possible 
 that a payment agreement does not have a party. A payment agreement without 
 a party is a general agreement which is applicable for all parties.</p>
        <h3>Correspondent roles at payment agreement level</h3>
        <p>Once the payment agreement is selected, some more correspondent role's 
 are introduced:</p>
        <p>The <b>holder</b> of the payment agreement is another reimburser 
 type. A payment agreement can also involve a <b>fund</b>. A 
 fund is typically an organization which is not at all related to the order 
 or order set, except that it is involved in the billing process.</p>
        <p>A payment agreement determines the policy. At policy clause level one 
 can still select a <b>specific instance</b> as reimburser type.</p>
        <p>One can also specify a <b>Billing Partner</b>.</p>
        <p>So, each of the 'correspondent roles' marked in <b>bold</b>, 
 can be selected as reimburser type of a <a href="../configuration/policy_clauses.htm">policy 
 clause</a>.</p>
