        <h1>Genetics (former features)</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This page describes the obsolete features in GLIMS that can be used 
 to support genetics. This features are independent of the new <a href="../genetics/introduction.htm">Genetics module</a>.</p>
        <h2>Using anatomic pathology configuration and routine screens</h2>
        <p>When implementing genetics in Glims, you can use the configuration and 
 routine screens that were originally designed to support anatomic pathology 
 in Glims.&#160;&#160;<a href="../pathology/index_pathology.htm">For more 
 information, please check the chapter "Anatomic pathology"</a>.</p>
        <p>The pathology screen can be used in a more adapted way to genetics labs.&#160;&#160;To 
 activate this, the user must be logged on in a department for which the 
 field "Specialty" is set to "Genetics".<br /><br />When this is the case, the pathology screen (now 'genetic work screen') 
 will behave different in the following ways:</p>
        <p>In the tree view section, it will show all specimens contained in the 
 order, even if they are not root specimens (in pathology mode, only root 
 specimens are shown).</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">When clicking on a sub-specimen (non-root-specimen) 
	 in the tree view section, the result section will show all results 
	 that were directly derived form this sub-specimen (also known as 'work 
	 specimen'). When clicking on the root specimen, these results will 
	 not be shown there.<br />	&#160;</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">The buttons 'Add block(s)' and 'Add slide(s)' are 
	 not visible, since they are typically used for anatomic pathology.<br />	&#160;</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="3">A button 'Add request(s)' is visible in the screen's 
	 toolbar. This button performs the method 'Specimen.AddRequest()' on 
	 the specimen that is currently selected in the tree view section (root 
	 specimen or sub specimen).<br />	&#160;</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="4">Some buttons that are available in the contextual 
	 ribbon (at the top of the GLIMS window) are 'inherited' in this screen's 
	 toolbar. The concerned buttons are:<br />	&#160; 
	<ul><li class="kadov-p" value="1">buttons that have as base table one of the 
		 following: Specimen, Procedure, Result, PathologyExam, Property, 
		 Object, HealthCareProvider, Order.</li><li class="kadov-p" value="2">buttons that have a valid 'image up' icon.</li><li class="kadov-p" value="3">buttons for which the user is privileged.<br />		&#160;</li></ul></li>
            <li value="5">Results will be grouped by the action of which they are output.</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
            <p>By default results in the pathology screen are displayed in the following 
 sequence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">first by the sequence number of the procedure (which they are output 
	 of)</li>
                <li value="2">then by the sequence number of their procedure output</li>
                <li value="3">then by creation time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In some cases, e.g. if the same procedure and the same tests are present 
 multiple times for the same specimen (e.g. in genetics), this may look 
 confusing.</p>
            <p>Example (with 2 actions for procedure 'Proc1'):</p>
            <blockquote><pre>
Proc1 &#160;- Test1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(from Action1)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Test1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(from Action2)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Test2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(from Action1)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Test2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(from Action2)
Proc2 &#160;- ...</pre>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Therefore, when the pathology screen is used as a genetics work screen, 
 results will be grouped by their 'Action' before grouping by their procedure 
 output. The example output above would then become:</p>
            <blockquote><pre>
Proc1 &#160;- Test1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(from Action1)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Test2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(from Action1)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Test1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(from Action2)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Test2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(from Action2)
Proc2 &#160;- ...</pre>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Person relations</h2>
        <h3>Definition in Glims</h3>
        <p>Glims allow to define person relations.&#160;&#160;<a href="hla_configuration.htm#Person%20relations">Click 
 here for more information</a>.</p>
        <h3>Export to Gedcom</h3>
        <p>Starting from a person, it is possible to <a href="hla_export_person_relation_gedcom.htm">export 
 all related persons (the person's family) into a file in GEDCOM format</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="Genetic_disorders" id="Genetic_disorders"></a>Genetic disorders</h2>
        <p>Glims allows storing a person's <a href="genetic_disorders.htm">genetic 
 disorders</a>.</p>
        <h2>Studies</h2>
        <p>Glims also support studies for a genetics lab.&#160;&#160;<a href="../../configuration/studies/studies.htm">Please 
 check the chapter "Studies" for more information</a>.</p>
        <h2>Foetus</h2>
        <p>GLIMS allows to mark a person as a 'foetus' (an unborn person). This 
 is can be useful when tests are being performed on a pregnant mother or 
 on her foetus.&#160;&#160;When this person has been born (the birth has 
 taken place) successfully, it is possible to create a new person for this, 
 which of course will not be marked as 'foetus'.&#160;&#160;In this case 
 it can be interesting to link this born person to the original 'foetus' 
 person.&#160;</p>
        <p><a href="genetics_foetus.htm">Click here for more information on how 
 to configure this in Glims.</a>
