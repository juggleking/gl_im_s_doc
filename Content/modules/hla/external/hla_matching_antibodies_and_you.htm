        <p>The purpose of this booklet is to aid patients' understanding of tissue 
matching and antibody production. Since matching and antibodies can play an 
important role in transplantation, we thought we would take the time to explain 
a few central concepts and ideas important to kidney and/or pancreas 
transplantation. </p>

        <h3>What is HLA matching?</h3>
        <p>When two people share the same <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">H</span></b>uman 
<b><span style="color: #0033cc;">L</span></b>eukocyte <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">A</span></b>ntigens (abbreviated as <span style="color: #0033cc;"><b>HLA</b></span>), they are said to be a "match", that is, their tissues are 
immunologically compatible with each other. <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> are proteins that are located on the surface 
of the white blood cells and other tissues in the body. </p>
        <center>

            </p>
        </center>
        <p>There are three general groups of <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b>, they 
are HLA-A,HLA-B and HLA-DR. There are many different specific <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> proteins within each of these three groups. (For 
example, there are 59 different HLA-A proteins, 118 different HLA-B and 124 
different HLA-DR!) Each of these <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> has a 
different numerical designation, for example, you may have HLA-A1, while some 
one else might have HLA-A2. </p>

        <p>In the diagram below we can see how a child inherits one <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> in each group, from his/her parents. </p>

        <p>If two children inherit the very same <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> 
from their parents, they are an <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> "identical 
match". While another child in the same family can inherit a different 
combination of <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b>: </p>

        <center>
            <p><b>This child does not match at all with his/her sibling.</b>
            </p>
        </center>
        <p>It is important to know that <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> is 
inherited as a "set" of the three <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> groups, 
A, B, DR. This set is known as a "haplotype". Below you will notice the father 
has 2 distinct <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> haplotypes. </p>
        <p>
            <br clear="all" />

            </p>
        </center>
        <p>You inherit one haplotype from each parent. Therefore, there are a total of 
<b>four</b> different haplotype combinations from 2 parents. </p>
        <p>There is a basic rule in <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> inheritance. 
The rule is: you have a 25% chance of inheriting all of the same <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> (same 2 haplotypes) as any one of your siblings, 
you have a 25% chance of not inheriting any of the same <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> (none of the same haplotypes) and you have a 50% 
chance of sharing I haplotype with your siblings. <b>Therefore, you have a 1 in 
4 chance of being an identical match with your siblings.</b></p>

        </center>
        <p>After <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> is determined, there is a second 
test which will indicate if there is specific immune reactivity between 
the donor and recipient. This test is the "crossmatch". </p>
        <h3>What is the crossmatch?</h3>
        <p>The crossmatch is a test which determines if the recipient has<b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> to the potential donor. <b><span style="color: #009933;">Antibody</span></b> is a protein, present in the serum, which 
could injure the donor's cells by attacking the <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b>. The <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> 
will only injure the donor's cells if it is specific for the donor's 
particular<b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> Not everyone has antibody 
against <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b>. </p>
        <p>
            <br clear="all" />
        </p>
        <center>
            <p>
                <img src="images/hla_10_178x125.gif" style="width: 178;height: 125;" />
            </p>
        </center>
        <p>The crossmatch is performed by mixing a very small amount of the patient's 
serum with a very small amount of the potential donor's white 
cells. If the patient has <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> to the 
donor's <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b>, the donor's cells will be injured 
and this is referred to as a "positive crossmatch". A positive crossmatch is a 
strong indication against transplant, since it signifies that the patient has 
the ability to attack the donor's cells, and would, most likely attack the 
donor's implanted kidney. </p>
        <p>
            <br clear="all" />

                <img height="116" src="images/hla_11.gif" width="221" />
            </p>
        </center>
        <p>Notice how the patient's antibody fits the donor's <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> just as a lock and key. This means that somehow, 
the patient has developed an antibody to the donor's <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> type. </p>
        <p>There could be any number of reasons why the patient could have <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> to the donor's <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b>. The most common causes of <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> production are: 
transfusions, transplants and/or pregnancies. So, we hope the crossmatch will be 
negative. A negative crossmatch indicates that the patient does not have<b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span><span style="color: #009933;">antibody </span></b>against 
that particular donor, and a transplant can be performed. <br clear="all" /></p>

            <img height="106" src="images/hla_13.gif" width="95" align="left" />  Since a patient can <b>develop</b><b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> after a transfusion, it is very important to 
submit a blood sample to the Tissue Typing Laboratory no later than 7-14 days 
after each transfusion.</p>

        <p>
            <img height="83" src="images/hla_14.gif" width="93" align="right" /> At any time, a patients may request a kit (tube and 
packaging material) from the lab, for a posttransfusion sample. It is 
extremely important to inform us each time that you receive a transfusion. 
This will help us to keep track of your post-transfusion <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> levels (your <b><span style="color: #cc0033;">PRA</span></b>). </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>What is PRA?</h3>
        <p><b><span style="color: #cc0033;">PRA</span></b> (<b><span style="color: #cc0033;">P</span></b>ercent <b><span style="color: #cc0033;">R</span></b>eactive 
<b><span style="color: #cc0033;">A</span></b>ntibody) is the amount of <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA </span><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> present in a 
patient's serum. As stated before, the patient could have <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> as a result of 
transfusions, prior transplants, and/or pregnancies. The <b><span style="color: #cc0033;">PRA</span></b> is determined by testing the patient's serum to a 
panel of 60 different types of <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b>. If, for 
example, the patient's serum reacts with 30 out of 60 <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b>, then the patient's <b><span style="color: #cc0033;">PRA</span></b> is 50% (1/2 of 60). The <b><span style="color: #cc0033;">PRA</span></b> is calculated for each monthly serum sample. </p>
        <p>
            <br clear="all" />
        </p>
        <center>
            <p>
                <img src="images/hla_15_172x117.gif" style="width: 172;height: 117;" />
            </p>
        </center>
        <p>In addition to determining how much or how little<b><span style="color: #cc0033;">PRA</span></b> a patient has, we need to know how specific the 
<b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> is. That is, is the <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> specific to a particular <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b>. For example, if you received a transfusion from a 
donor with HLA-A2, you may develop <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> to 
A2. That's <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> specificity. Some patients 
have one or two <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b>specificities, while 
others have numerous specificities. We are able to determine the specificity at 
the same time which we test for the monthly <b><span style="color: #cc0033;">PRA</span>.</b></p>
        <center>
            <p>

                <img height="137" src="images/hla_16.gif" width="152" />
            </p>
        </center>
        <p>Therefore, the monthly <b><span style="color: #cc0033;">PRA</span></b> gives us two 
very important pieces of information about the patient's serum: </p>
        <center>

                <img height="210" src="images/hla_17.gif" width="211" />
            </p>
        </center>
        <p>Since <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> can "come and go", it is important to test for 
the<b><span style="color: #cc0033;">PRA</span></b> regularly. For this reason, we mail a 
tube to the patient, for a blood sample, on a monthly basis. Monthly testing not 
only gives us a continuous "look-see" at the patient's <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b>, but it also 
gives us an array of samples with which we can perform crossmatches for each 
specific donor. The most recent monthly sample is used as the current sample, 
and must always be included in the pretransplant crossmatch. </p>

        <h3>Most frequently asked questions</h3>
        <p>1. <b>Can my <span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span> change?</b></p>
        <p>Yes. <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> levels can be high following a 
transfusion but then decrease significantly months later. </p>
        <p>2. <b>Why do I need to submit a monthly sample if I have not received a 
transfusion?</b></p>
        <p>Sometimes, a patient can have <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> that 
mimics <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b>. Even though it is not harmful <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b>, it is difficult for us to determine the cause 
of the <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> production. Sometimes, even a 
strept throat infection can cause <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> 
production which can be confused with <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b>. So, it is important for us to monitor monthly 
serum samples and correlate the <b><span style="color: #009933;">antibody</span></b> 
production with medical events - such as infections, medications, etc. </p>
        <p>3. <b>If my sibling and I have the same blood group, then why wouldn't we 
have the same <span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span>?</b></p>
        <p>The ABO blood group genetic system and the<b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> genetic system are not inherited together. So, just 
as your gene (the <b><span style="color: #990099;">DNA</span></b>) for eye color is 
separate from your gene (the <b><span style="color: #990099;">DNA</span></b>) for your 
blood group, so is your <b><span style="color: #990099;">DNA</span></b> for <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b>. All of these genes are inherited independently 
from each other. </p>

        </center>
        <p>Clearly, the further apart a potential donor is from your immediate family, 
the less likely they are to be an identical match. In the case of cousins, your 
chance of being identical is "1 in 16". In the case of a friend, then your 
chances vary depending on how common your <b><span style="color: #0033cc;">HLA</span></b> is. </p>
