        </p>
        <p>The work done by a microbiology instrument can be represented in GLIMS 
 by the reading phase of a microbiology examination. The reading phase 
 on itself is represented as a non-microbiology procedure, say the "processing 
 procedure". The processing procedure is configured on the microbiology 
 instrument station. The processing property of the microbiology procedure 
 should be output of the processing procedure.</p>
        <p>During the reading phase, the current station of the microbiology action 
 should be the microbiology instrument station. A "next station" 
 expression in the microbiology procedure assures that the processing phase 
 is done on the processing station. For instance:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>if .status &lt; StringToEnumerated("MicrobiologyActionStatus", 
 "Reading")<br />then return "GraftingStation";<br />else return "ProcessingStation";<br />endif;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Where "GraftingStation" and "ProcessingStation" 
 are the mnemonic of the grafting- and processing station respectively. 
 In this example, phases before the reading phase (status less than "reading"), 
 are done on the station with mnemonic "GraftingStation". From 
 the reading phase on (status greater than or equal "Reading"), 
 the microbiology action station is set to the station with mnemonic "ProcessingStation".</p>

        <p>Suppose that the instrument also requires isolated microorganisms to

 to the instrument, microorganism tests should be configured on the microbiology 
 instrument station. The microorganism tests are output of a non-microbiology 
 procedure on the microbiology instrument station, say the "microorganism 
 test procedure". The input of the procedure is the microbiology material.</p>
        <p>The microorganism test methods should have an outbound id filled in

        <h2><a name="Uploading results from the instrument to GLIMS"></a>Uploading 
 results from the instrument to GLIMS</h2>
        <h3><a name="Uploading an isolation"></a>Uploading an isolation</h3>
        <p>The upload of an isolation to GLIMS consists of at least a specimen 
 and an isolation number. The way isolation numbers are interpreted by 
 GLIMS depends on the fact whether the station has an <a href="microbiology_analyzers_isolation_sequences.htm">isolation 
 sequence type</a> or not.</p>
        <p>GLIMS offers the possibility to automatically confirm isolations uploaded 
 from the instrument. Set the toggle box "Auto confirm isolations" 
 in the microbiology tab folder of the instrument's station. Unset the 
 toggle box to disable auto-confirmation.</p>
        <h3><a name="Uploading extra information with an isolation"></a>Uploading extra 
 information with an isolation</h3>
        <p>In most of the cases, the microorganism code and antibiotic results 
 are uploaded with the isolation. The microorganism code and the antibiotic 
 codes should be defined in GLIMS as described above.</p>
        <p>Additional information can be uploaded with the isolation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">Internal comment<br /><br />	Some instruments provide extra information about the isolated organism. 
	 This information is stored in GLIMS in the internal comment of the 
	 isolation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">Microbiology examination code<br /><br />	In a particular case it is required that the instrument uploads to 
	 GLIMS for which microbiology examination on a specimen the isolation 
	 was found. The uploaded examination code should match with a mnemonic 
	 of a microbiology procedure in GLIMS. See below for more details.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">Trigger test code<br /><br />	The trigger test code is an alternative for the microbiology examination

        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Uploading isolations for specimens with multiple examinations"></a>Uploading 
 isolations for specimens with multiple examinations</h3>
        <p>This paragraph concerns microbiology stations with an <a href="microbiology_analyzers_isolation_sequences.htm">isolation 
 sequence type</a>. Remember that isolation sequences imply that isolations 
 in GLIMS are not supposed to be created beforehand (see "Uploading 
 an isolation").</p>
        <p>Some laboratories have multiple microbiology procedures defined for 
 the same material. This results in several microbiology actions for the 
 same specimen. Suppose a new isolation is uploaded to GLIMS and the station 
 is configured with an isolation sequence type. In that case, GLIMS must 
 know for which microbiology procedure this new isolation is to be created.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">

        </p>
        <p>There are several ways to solve this problem:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">(Re)configure the 2 microbiology procedures as 
	 examinations on a different type of material. This has as side-effect 
	 that GLIMS creates 2 specimens. Consequently, the instrument should 
	 use 2 different specimen id's, one for each examination.<br /><br /><img src="../MicroSingleExam.gif" alt="MicroSingleExam.gif (2825 bytes)" width="402" height="265" border="0" /></li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">The instrument uploads a microbiology examination 
	 code along with the isolation. The examination code should match with 
	 the mnemonic of the microbiology procedure in GLIMS.<br /><br /><img src="../MicroUplExamCode.gif" alt="MicroUplExamCode.gif (3738 bytes)" width="468" height="410" border="0" /></li>
            <li style="text-align: left;" value="3">As an alternative 
	 for 2), the instrument uploads a trigger test code. The trigger test 
	 code should match with the inbound id of a processing property assessment 
	 method. The microbiology procedure is found by means of that processing 
	 property.<br /><br /><img src="../MicroUplTriggTest.gif" alt="MicroUplTriggTest.gif (5320 bytes)" width="653" height="398" border="0" /></li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="Uploading antibiotic results"></a>Uploading antibiotic results</h3>
        <p>GLIMS supports several types of antibiotic results that can be uploaded 
 with an isolation. Which antibiotic result types are uploaded depends 
 on what the instrument is capable of and what its communication protocol 
 supports.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">RIS value: The value is one of 'R', 'I' or 'S'</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">RIS report value: The value is one of 'R', 'I' 
	 or 'S'</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="3">MIC raw value: The MIC raw value is a string value 
	 consisting of an optional comparator sign (&gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=) 
	 and a decimal value. For instance "&lt;= 20.0"</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="4">Agar diffusion value: A decimal value</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="5">E-test value: Any string value</li>
        </ol>
        <p>GLIMS offers the possibility to <b>automatically confirm antibiotic 
 results</b> uploaded from the instrument. Set the toggle box <b><i>Auto 
 confirm antibiotic results</i></b> in the microbiology tab folder of the 
 instrument's station. If set, the Antibiogram Validation MISPL of the 
 micro-organism will also be executed.</p>
        <p>GLIMS also allows <b>automatic antibiogram creation</b>. This 
 can be configured using the <b>Antibiotic panel mode field</b> in the 
 Microbiology tab folder of the Station. Possible values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1"><b style="font-weight: bold;">None</b> (no panel 
	 creation, allow any result)</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Reject</b> non members</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="3"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Non members</b> not 
	 reportable</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If set to <b>None</b>, all antibiotic results transmitted by the instrument 
 are stored.</p>
            <p>With the <b>second</b> and <b>third</b> option, an antibiogram will 
 be generated automatically at the moment the first result arrives. The 
 results of non antibiotic panel members that are transmitted by the instrument 
 will be rejected or will be set to not reportable (2nd and 3rd option).</p>
            <p>Note<i>:</i><br />When the 2nd or the 3rd option is active, beware that results will also 
 be rejected or will also be set to not reportable when no antibiotic panel 
 is generated for the isolation concerned.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>When uploading microbiology results from an analyzer, the following 
 rules are applied:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="1">An antibiotic result which is confirmed will not 
	 be overwritten when a new value is received from the analyzer.</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="2">The microbiology action status is automatically 
	 upgraded to 'reading' when the first valid isolation is received from 
	 the analyzer.</li>
            <li class="kadov-p" value="3">When a microbiology action with status read-confirmed, 
	 read-validated or ready receives an uploaded isolation with a micro-organism 
	 different from the isolation already stored, the microbiology action

            <li class="kadov-p" value="4">When a microbiology action with status read-confirmed, 
	 read-validated or ready receives a new uploaded isolation (with a

        <h3><a name="Uploading isolation test results"></a>Uploading isolation test

        <p>Results of microorganism tests on an isolation can be uploaded to GLIMS 
 as well. Configure microorganism test methods on the instrument's station

        <p>Suppose the laboratory has a new microbiology instrument and would like 
 to reuse the already configured microbiology procedures from an existing 
 station and would like to have the option to choose on which station the 
 specimen is to be processed.</p>
        <p>This can be realized by filling in an identical remote id on both stations 
 (the value of the remote id can be chosen freely). If the new instrument 
 should also be able to process the microbiology actions of the station 
 on which they were initially scheduled, one should create dummy processing 
 procedures for the new station. Such a dummy procedure has no input but 
 shares the same processing property.</p>
        <h2><a name="Carrier_information" id="Carrier_information"></a>Carrier information 
 in communication between GLIMS and analyzer</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>GLIMS is capable of sending microbiology carrier information in communication 
 with microbiology instruments. GLIMS will also take into account 
 the MIPS ASTM field R.11.1.1 (Instrument operator) in order to log the 
 user that caused an update of the following GLIMS records: Isolation (isolation 
 audit trail) and AntibioticResult (antibiotic result audit trail). This 
 will be active if the field Station.StoreOperator is set. If the option 
 is set, the user must exist in GLIMS (login name or initials should match 
 with R.11.1.1). If not, upload is rejected!</p>
        <h3>Download</h3>
        <p>Download of carriers is supported for queries on single specimen only 
 (not for batch download ALL-query). Upon download to a microbiology 
 instrument, GLIMS can send carriers to the instrument (when the translator 
 requests for it). If in the MIPS ASTM query message - a query 
 specific tag Q.15.1.1 'Carriers' is present, GLIMS will try to send carrier 
 information for:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">specimens being downloaded by means of a grafting/processing property 
	 - no isolations are sent. In this case, GLIMS will send all carriers 
	 related to that specimen.</li>
            <li value="2">specimens being downloaded via isolation tests - isolations are 
	 sent. In this case, GLIMS will send all carriers related to the specimen 
	 and also the carriers related to the isolation (meaning a carrier 
	 might be sent twice for a specimen)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The carrier information is downloaded in a M-segment of the MIPS ASTM 
 message:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>M | segment.no | carr ^ carrier | carrier_seqno | medium</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>where</p>

        <p>GLIMS can process carrier information that is sent with a specimen or 
 an isolation. The information is sent in M-segments of the MIPS ASTM message. 
 When a carrier is sent with a specimen, GLIMS will not link isolations 
 to that carrier. When a carrier is sent with an isolation, GLIMS will 
 set the isolation's carrier to that one.</p>
        <p>Two message types are used:</p>
        <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Carrier record</b>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>M | segment.no | carr ^ Carrier | carrier_seqno | medium | actioncode 
 | operatorid</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>where</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">carrier_seqno = the carrier sequence number in GLIMS</li>
            <li value="2">medium = Medium.Mnemonic or Station.CodingSytem.CodeSet(Medium).Code.Value</li>
            <li value="3">actioncode = 'N' or 'U' (new/update)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Carrier comment record</b>:</p>
        <p>M | segment.no | carc ^ CarrierComment | ^ text ^ actioncode</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">text = carrier comment field in GLIMS</li>
            <li value="2">actioncode = 'R' or 'A' (replace/add)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A carrier comment record will always follow a carrier record, meaning 
 that the comment is related to that carrier.</p>
