            <MadCap:concept term="Microbiology" />Microbiology analyzers - isolation sequence types</h1>
        <h2>Background information</h2>
        <p>When multiple <a href="microbiology_analyzers.htm">microbiology analyzers</a> 
 (e.g. scanbac r√©sultats, SIR, Vitek, Maldi) are working simultaneously 
 on the same specimen, conflicts could arise in external isolation numbering.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <h3>Station fields</h3>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Isolation sequence type</p>
        <p class="fielddescription">By defining an isolation sequence type per 
 station, each station can have its proper isolation sequence numbering. 
 Multiple stations can share the same type.</p>
        <p class="fielddescription">
            <img src="../station_isolation_sequence_type.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Isolation numbering</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>The isolation numbering is implicitly determined: 
 </p>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">for stations with an isolation sequence 
	 type, an external numbering is used (isolation sequence).</li>
                <li value="2">for stations without an isolation sequence 
	 type, an internal GLIMS numbering is used (Isolation.InternalSequencer)</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h3>Isolation sequence type</h3>
        <p>Isolation sequence types can be defined from the main menu via "Start 
 -&gt; Microbiology -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Isolation sequence types".</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../isolation_sequence_type_fields.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Mnemonic</p>
        <p class="fielddescription">Unique identifier for the isolation sequence 
 type.</p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Scope</p>
        <p class="fielddescription">Defines the scope within which the isolation 
 sequences must be unique (per specimen or per microbiology action).</p>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Creation mode</p>
        <p class="fielddescription">Defines when the isolation sequence should 
 be created: when creating an isolation or when creating an isolation test.</p>
        <p class="fielddescription" style="font-style: italic;">Note: the creation mode is ignored when the 
 isolation is being created upon upload of a result message on a station 
 having this isolation sequence type defined.</p>
        <h3>Creation of an isolation sequence</h3>
        <p>The isolation sequences are either created on insert of an isolation, 
 or on insert of an isolation test. The creation mode is set on the isolation 
 sequence type. </p>
        <p>The isolation sequence value field is automatically incremented, based 
 on the scope of the isolation sequence type (unique number per specimen 
 or per microbiology action) and the highest value within that scope. The 
 isolation sequence value might also be assigned when the isolation is 
 uploaded from a station to GLIMS. The upload message contains the value 
 for the isolation sequence.</p>
        <p>Setting the creation mode of an isolation sequence type to "isolation 
 test" may result in the creation of isolation sequences for the isolation 
 on which an isolation test is being inserted. The sequences are created 
 for each isolation sequence type with that creation mode, and used by 
 a station which has an organism test method configured for that isolation 
 test. The organism test method should be enabled and have an outbound 
 id filled in.</p>
        <h3>Isolation sequence creation upon station result upload</h3>
        <p>Upon isolation upload from a station to GLIMS, GLIMS may create sequences 
 for the isolation sequence type defined on the uploading station and any 
 other isolation sequence type.</p>
        <h4>Isolation sequence of the uploading station</h4>
        <p>GLIMS may create isolation sequences for isolations uploaded to GLIMS 
 on a station for which an isolation sequence type is defined. The isolation 
 sequence type creation mode of the uploading station has no influence 
 on that creation.</p>
        <p>If no sequence value exists with a matching value, then GLIMS will create 
 a new isolation sequence and set the value to the one received from the 
 analyzer. If the analyzer did not send a sequence value, then GLIMS will 
 calculate the value based on the isolation sequence values already defined 
 for that sequence type.</p>
        <p>If an isolation already exists with the same sequence value, then the 
 sequence value remains and the isolation is updated where necessary (other 
 organism, antibiotic result values, etc).</p>
        <p>GLIMS will not create isolation sequences if no isolation sequence type 
 is defined on the uploading station. Consequently, the isolation is rejected.</p>
        <h4>Isolation sequences for other stations</h4>
        <p>On creation of the uploaded isolation in GLIMS, GLIMS will try to create 
 isolation sequence values for any sequence type defined on another station 
 than the uploading station, and different than the one defined on the 
 uploading station. </p>
        <p>If the creation mode of that other sequence type is set to isolation, 
 then the sequence is created and calculated unconditionally. If the isolation 
 creation involves automatic creation of isolation tests (for instance 
 triggered by a MISPL function), then sequence records are created for 
 isolation sequence types with mode set to isolation test.</p>
        <h3>Isolation sequence creation when no station is involved</h3>
        <p>As described above, a station result upload to GLIMS might lead to the 
 creation of isolation sequences. </p>
        <p>Isolation sequences are also created when an isolation is inserted through 
 other means. For instance: when an isolation is inserted in the microbiology 
 work screen, or when isolations are created by means of electronic communication 
 (not originating from an analyzer).</p>
        <p>When no station is involved, GLIMS will create sequences for any type 
 configured on at least one station and having the creation mode set to 
 isolation.</p>
        <h3>Work order message transmitted to a station</h3>
        <p>When downloading isolations to the analyzer, GLIMS will send one of 
 the following items as isolation sequence value in the work order message:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li value="1">If an isolation sequence type is defined on the station: the value 
	 of the isolation sequence record</li>
            <li value="2">If no isolation sequence type is defined on the station: the Isolation.InternalSequencer</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Deleting isolations in GLIMS</h3>
        <p>Deleting an isolation in GLIMS will not lead to the deletion of related 
 isolation sequence records. The reference to the isolation however will 
 be removed. GLIMS will consider reusing an existing isolation sequence record before deciding to create a new one: if, for a given isolation and sequence value, GLIMS finds an existing isolation sequence record</p>
        <ol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <li value="1">for the current isolation sequence type,</li>
            <li value="2">for the specimen of the isolation,</li>
            <li value="3">for the action of the isolation,</li>
            <li value="4">with a sequence value that is identical to the one GLIMS is trying to use for the current isolation,</li>
            <li value="5">with an unknown isolation reference,</li>
        </ol>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">then this record will be reused.</p>
        <h3>Isolate sequence access via MISPL</h3>
        <p>Label printing of isolation tests may require the value of the isolation 
 sequence for a related station. The micro-organism test field <span class="ui_element">Label 
 to print</span> allows to define an IsolationTest-based text module. This 
 text module can now use the following Isolation-based MISPL function:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Integer</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">GetSequence</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">String</span> <span style="color: #008000;">IsolationSequenceTypeMnemonic</span>)</p>
        <p>This function returns the sequence value (integer) for a given isolation 
 sequence type.</p>
        <h3>Consultation of isolation sequences</h3>
        <p style="background-color: Transparent;">The values of the isolation sequences 
 are visible in the <a href="../routine/microbiology_work_screen_isolation_isolation_tests.htm">isolation 
 browser of the microbiology screen</a>, in the column named "Seq". 
 The column is only visible when at least one "External sequencer" 
 exists or an "Isolation sequence" exists for one of the isolations 
 of the microbiology action.</p>
        <p style="background-color: Transparent;">The isolation sequence values 
 are also visualized in the isolation editor (tab folder "detail").</p>
