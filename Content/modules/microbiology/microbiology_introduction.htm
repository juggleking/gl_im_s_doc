            <MadCap:concept term="Microbiology" /><a name="kanchor187"></a>Microbiology - Introduction</h1>
        <p>A microbiology examination differs considerably from a regular chemistry 
 analysis. One of the main differences lies in the fact that in many cases 
 the lab is provided with a material 
 and a question 'See what you can find'. The microbiological examination 
 of a patient sample can involve several steps and the findings can lead 
 to further examination. For instance, in many cases, a coloring is performed 
 on the specimen in order to be able to detect any germ presence under 
 a microscope. After this so-called Gram-coloring, so-called Gram-positive 
 germs appear as blue colonies, while Gram-negative germs appear as red 
 colonies. This microscopic examination helps to determine whether further 
 tests are to be undertaken.</p>
        <p>When presence of health threatening germs is suspected, the germs are 
 transferred to one or more nutrient matrices in order to let them incubate. 
 The nutrients used can depend of many factors (e.g. the result of the 
 Gram-coloring, the material, the origin of the material, the patient characteristics,...). 
 This growth is examined at regular intervals. After this stage, several 
 tests (e.g. growth rate, visual aspects, mobility, sugar consumption, 
 reaction to certain antibiotics...) can lead to an identification of the 
 germ.</p>
        <p>After, or during this step, the lab can decide to test a number of antibiotics on the organism. The 
 actual antibiotics tested depend on the germ type, material, patient data 
 and more. In many labs, fixed antibiotic 
 panels are used. The reaction of the germ to the antibiotics is stored 
 either in numerical form like the diameter of the growth inhibition zone 
 around an antibiotic pellet, or in a code form R(esistant), I(ntermediary), 
 S(ensitive). </p>
        <p>Since the procedures to 
 be carried out and the results to be stored are not known beforehand, 
 the Microbiology LIS subsystem should be very flexible in its data model 
 and user interface. It should be able to suggest procedures to be undertaken 
 by evaluating the current specimen data, but should allow storage of any 
 related or intermediary result entered by the analyst.</p>
        <p>All relevant data should be stored in a way that permits easy and fast 
 retrieval of result for daily result operation, previous patient results, 
 statistical and epidemiological reports, …</p>
        <p>In microbiology, the specimen should not only be characterized by its 
 material. It might be necessary to specify the method used to obtain the 
 specimen (sounded, smearing, puncture, ...), the actual body part of the 
 patient and others. Some of these characteristics only serve to be reported 
 back to the issuer, while others play a role in the technical process. 
 This is met by adding a table MaterialVariable 
 as a child table of the material table. Each MaterialVariable has a name 
 and a predetermined set of possible values, which are stored in the Material
 VariableChoice table (e.g. "Method" with as values "Sounded,Midstream,Other", 
 "Location" with as values "Left arm, right arm"). 
 While entering the specimen into the system, the operator may be required 
 to specify the actual values for these characteristics. The values can 
 then be taken into account by procedure eligibility expressions to determine 
 which procedure should be carried out.</p>
        <p>The table MicrobiologyProcedure 
 defines which examinations can be undertaken for each material type. Examples 
 are: "General microbiological examination", "Anaerobe culture", 
 "Research on Adeno virus". Actually requesting such a procedure 
 results in the creation of a Microbiology 
 Action, which will be the centerpiece of further data entry. All isolations 
 and carriers refer to this record.</p>
        <p>In order to be able to reuse this module for other purposes (such as 
 virology or parasitology), all microorganism definitions are stored in 
 a table called MicroOrganism. 
 Subtypes of microorganisms are "Germ" (includes microbes and 
 fungi), "Virus" or "Parasite". </p>
        <p>Creating an Isolation record 
 in the database represents the actual presence of such a microorganism 
 in a specimen. This record refers to the specimen in which the organism 
 was found and to the microorganism’s definition. The isolation can also 
 refer a Carrier (Carr), which 
 represents the physical carrier on which the organism was grafted and 
 which contains a specific Medium 
 (Mdm) (e.g. blood agar). Medium 
 Usage (MdU) records determine under which circumstances a specific 
 medium should be used (depending on material, requested procedure and 
 an optional MISPL expression)</p>
        <p>Each microorganism contains information about the organism (such as 
 mnemonic, name, medical information, ...) but can also refer to another 
 microorganism to indicate a microorganism of which this organism is a 
 special case (e.g. an organism Bacteroides levii can refer to Bacteroides 
 species) for use in incomplete determinations or for statistical purposes.</p>
        <p>The table Antibiotic (Ab) contains mnemonic, name, reporting 
 order (if any), medical comments and other information. Special formulas 
 assist in the calculation of the RIS code starting from a Kerby-Bauer 
 or MIC numerical value. Antibiotic 
 Panel (AbP) groups antibiotics into panels. The Antibiotic 
 Panel Usage indicates the conditions under which a panel should be 
 chosen as the default panel to be tested, given a certain combination 
 of microorganism and specimen material. MISPL expressions allow the use of further selection criteria such as patient age, patient location, issuer, 
 ... Of course, at run time, the analyst can decide to suppress or add 
 antibiotics for a specific specimen.</p>
        <p>Each actual antibiotic result is stored in an Antibiotic 
 Result (AbRs) record, referring to the antibiotic and the isolation. 
 This record can store numerical and RIS values and the optional indication 
 whether this result can be reported.</p>
        <p>Results of macroscopic evaluation, microscopic evaluation, presence 
 of red or white blood cells, ... are entered as optional result outputs 
 of a normal procedure (comparable to chemistry results). At any time, 
 the user can decide to add extra procedures or results to the specimen 
 under study.</p>
        <p>Additional tests performed on the carriers can be stored in the CarrierTest (CarT) table. A carrier test refers to a Medium Test (MdT) definition and can be added automatically via the Medium 
 Test Usage (MdTU) parametrization, defining which medium tests should 
 normally be carried out on which media.</p>
        <p>Additional tests performed on the isolations can be stored in the IsolationTest (IsoT) table. 
 An isolation test refers to a Microorganism 
 Test (MOT) definition and can be added automatically via the Microorganism 
 Test Usage (MOTU) parametrization, defining which microorganism tests 
 normally should be carried out on which microorganism.</p>
