        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A station can either be a place where tests are executed manually, an analyzer, a concentrator, ...</p>
        <h2>General fields</h2>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Mnemonic</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>The default visible identification of the station.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Name</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>The name of the instrument, place of survey, ...</p>
        </div>
        <p class="fieldlabel">Type</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p class="fieldlabel">Analyzer</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>An analyzer can belong to a download group so that it can download actions scheduled on other stations with the same download group. When the inquiring station queries for actions, the outputs of the action scheduled on the other station should have at least an assessment method with the same property configured on the inquiring station. An analyzer station can be defined as client of a LAS or concentrator.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="fieldlabel">Concentrator</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>A concentrator station serves one or more client stations (stations of type <span class="ui_element">Analyzer</span>). The client stations normally have no translator, as all communication (result upload, patient download…) is handled by the concentrator station. Procedures with in- and outputs are defined on the client stations. GLIMS will use the in- and outbound id's of the client station's assessment methods.</p>
                <p>Result messages from the concentrator should be received with an accompanying instrument id. GLIMS will try to identify the concentrator client station with that instrument id (station remote id).</p>
            </div>
            <p class="fieldlabel">LAS</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>A LAS station serves one or more client stations but will only download actions to the station.&#160;&#160;Procedures with in- and outputs are defined on the client stations. GLIMS will use the in- and outbound id's of the LAS station to identify the assessment methods.</p>
                <p>Results are always transmitted via the client station. The client stations must therefore have their own translator.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="fieldlabel">Counter</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>Stations of type <span class="ui_element">Counter</span> are used for the cell counter program in GLIMS.&#160;&#160;A counter station can be recognized by a procedure with a cell count limit greater than zero.&#160;&#160;<a href="../../routine/cell_counter/index_cell_counter.htm">Check the chapter "Cell counter" for more information</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="indented">
                <p>Refers to a station for scanning specimens. A scan station does not have a translator nor a procedure.&#160;&#160;Can for instance be used in the <a href="../../modules/lab_archive/routine/lab_archive_store_specimens.htm">specimen archive module</a>.</p>

                <p>Station used for calculated results (i.e. results where the PropertyOutput.Value contains a formula AND where the action has at least one input result).&#160;&#160;For calculation procedures, the <span class="ui_element">Value</span> field of the property output should be specified.</p>

The material of the specimen in GLIMS must match the material in the result message. If the station of the result message sending translator has a coding system with a code set on <span class="ui_element">Material</span>, then GLIMS will search for a code that matches the field value in O.16.1.1. If no coding system or no code set is defined on <span class="ui_element">Material</span>, GLIMS will search for a material with a mnemonic matching the field value in O.16.1.1. If the material could not be identified, then GLIMS will log a warning message (service log file).</p>
