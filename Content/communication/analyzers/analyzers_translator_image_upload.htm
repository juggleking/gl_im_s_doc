        <h1><a name="kanchor213"></a>Translator image upload</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><span style="color: #FF0000;">The program which stores images uploaded from an 
 analyzer in a result checks the "Images from Analysers" license.&#160; Please 
 verify that you have the correct license. When you do not have a valid 
 license, no images will be stored when the 30 day trial period has ended.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Glims supports analyzer image upload.&#160; Currently only a few translators 
 support this. These are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">the ABX Pentra Series (abx translator)</li>
            <li value="2">the Beckman Coulter MAXM and LH Series (stks translator)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Others may follow as the need arises, provided image transfer is supported by the host transmission interface of the device. Please contact your sales representative to find out whether or not this is available for a specific analyzer.</p>
        <p>Mode of operation:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">The image is transferred in a manufacturer proprietary format by the instrument along with the normal data stream.<br />    &#160;</li>
            <li value="2">It is converted to a common internal image format (currently run-length encoded bitmap) by the translator.<br />    &#160;</li>
            <li value="3">The converted image is wrapped in an XML document (base64 encoded) and sent as a normal result to the translator service.<br />    &#160;</li>
            <li value="4">If the property being uploaded is defined of data type 'Image', the service recognizes the XML document, unpacks the image and stores it at the appropriate place (either $GLIMSIMAGE or $ImageServerDir).<br />    &#160;</li>
            <li value="5">It can subsequently be viewed from any client PC provided the GLIMSIMAGE or ImageServerDir symbol (defined in Progress.ini) refers the same shared network folder as where the service stored the image file.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Images are stored as operating system files under the $GLIMSIMAGE or $ImageServerDir directory (evaluated in that order). By organizing that folder by means of a YYYY/MM/DD structure, each day of the year has its own sub-directory. The object date of the result is used as reference to avoid logistical problems when results are being re-sent across day boundaries.<br />    &#160;&#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Using the Bitmap Compressor (bmcp) translator</h2>
        <h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
        <p>GLIMS is capable of uploading, compressing, storing and retrieving images sent by an analyzer. This is handled by the translator server, in cooperation with the Bitmap Compressor (bmcp) translator.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>It is an obvious prerequisite that both the analyzer and its corresponding translator provide support for recuperation of images.&#160; Currently, this is only the case for the Bayer Advia 120 translator, via its "-i" startup parameter.</p>
        <h3><a name="Data flow"></a>Data flow (for the Bayer Advia 120)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Via the "-i" startup parameter of the "s79c" translator, information is passed to the analyzer about the location on the server where images should be put. See the s79c translator documentation for details.<br />    &#160;&#160;</li>
            <li value="2">On availability of an image, the image file test code (#250) is sent to the server if the Advia system is set to transmit images to the host computer.<br />    &#160;&#160;</li>
            <li value="3">More or less simultaneously, the Advia transmits its corresponding image via FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to the server in the directory designated by the "-i" startup option. The Advia bitmap file has a temporary non-unique name, assigned by the analyzer.<br />    &#160;&#160;</li>
            <li value="4">In GLIMS, an assessment method should exist with inbound id = "250", referring a property of data type 'Image'. On receipt of this test code, with the temporary filename as result value, the translator server determines a unique file name for the bitmap on the 'image server'. The image server is the 'heaven' of all images. It is a shared directory on any network server, accessible by all clients. Its location is designated by the "ImageServerDir" symbol (in the Progress.ini or .glimsrc file). The temporary file name is replaced by the unique file name in the result value, and a replacement log is added to the result. The unique name always has the format YYYY/MM/DD/&lt;TableShortName&gt;&lt;RecordId&gt;.bmp (like e.g. "2004/09/27/rslt139457.bmp").&#160; The required directories are automatically created.<br />    &#160;&#160;</li>
            <li value="5">The translator server creates a ".in" command file on the image server root directory containing both the temporary and the final file name. Each command file contains 1 line in the format: &lt;SourceFile&gt; &lt;TAB&gt; &lt;TargetFile&gt;. Here ends the job of the translator server.<br />    &#160;&#160;</li>
            <li value="6">The Bitmap Compressor translator regularly scans the image server root directory for ".in" command files. When found, the temporary file is moved to its final location under its new unique name, and compressed when possible. If successful, the command file is deleted afterwards.</li>
        </ol>
